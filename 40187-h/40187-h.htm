<h2>MODERN GEOGRAPHY</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF MODERN GEOGRAPHY</h3>


<p>In the year 1859 there occurred three
events which, though not all comparable
to one another, yet make the year one of
such importance that we may take it as
marking the beginning of the distinctively
modern period of geographical science. These
three events were, first, the deaths of Humboldt
and Ritter, two great geographical
pioneers who hewed tracks through the
tangled jungle of unsystematised geographical
facts, and second, the publication of the
<i>Origin of Species</i>, by Charles Darwin, a book
which supplied the compass which has made
further road-making in that same jungle
possible. In other words, as a result of the
life-work of the two great geographers named,
and of the throwing by Charles Darwin of<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></a>
a new ferment into the mass of contemporary
thought, what had been a mere collection
of facts began to be a reasoned and ordered
science. Both Humboldt and Ritter lived
to a great age, so that at the time of their
deaths not only was their work done, but
there had been time also for their influence
to permeate the literature of the subject.</p>

<p>Humboldt was, above all, a great traveller,
but he was also a man of science in the largest
sense, interested not in one group of facts,
but in many. The extent of his knowledge
and the breadth of his interests enabled him
to observe a vast number of phenomena
while his particular genius was manifest in
the way in which he correlated these, and
considered them in their relation to each
other. Though it is true that his influence
was most direct in the case of natural history,
yet in this respect also he pointed to the
future, for the geographers of to-day are indebted
to the naturalists for some of their
finest generalisations.</p>

<p>Ritter was a great teacher, the prototype
of those who alike by their personal influence
and by their books have enriched geographical
science within the last fifty years. He
had not Humboldt’s breadth of knowledge<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></a>
and interest, but in the stress which he laid
upon the earth as above all interesting in
that it is the field of the activity of man, he
emphasised an aspect of the subject in which
perhaps the most interesting modern developments
have taken place.</p>

<p>Darwin had a twofold effect upon the
progress of geography. In the first place, in
his detailed work, <i>e. g.</i> in connection with
coral reefs, and with the distribution of animals,
and less directly in his investigation of
the part played by earthworms in the formation
of soil, he himself added to geographical
knowledge. But he did much more than
this. The doctrine of evolution which he
made common property has had and is having
an enormous effect upon geographical science,
both directly and indirectly.</p>

<p>As is well known, in connection with his
own theory of the cause of evolution, Darwin
laid great stress upon the “Struggle for
Existence.” But he himself expressly stated
that he used the term in a “large and metaphorical
sense,” a sense which in popular
language it has tended to lose. From the
geographer’s standpoint, therefore, it is better
to say that Darwin’s work has added a new
interest to the study of interrelations. Humboldt,<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></a>
as we have indicated, was greatly
interested in such subjects as the connection
between the climate of a region and the vegetation,
between the activities of man in a
particular region and the physical conditions,
and so on. But Darwin added a new interest
to such studies. For example, it is a curious
fact that desert plants have often spiny
leaves, long roots, and so forth, and it is
interesting to note how these peculiarities fit
the plants for life in an arid climate. But
when Darwin showed that there was evidence
that the physical conditions of the desert
gave rise to certain types of vegetation, it
became worth while to study both the
physical conditions and the characters of
the plants in much greater detail than
before.</p>

<p>If we simply lay it down as an axiom that,
<i>e. g.</i> cactuses live in deserts, the fact has
only a moderate interest, but when we find
that almost any natural group of plants, if
exposed through long ages to gradually increasing
conditions of drought, will produce
“cactus” types, then the whole subject
acquires new importance. This illustration
may serve to suggest what Darwin has done
for geography.</p>

<p><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></a></p>

<p>He showed that there is a delicately adjusted
balance between organisms and their
surroundings, taken in their widest sense.
But geology proves that through the ages
there have been constant, if slight, changes
in the physical conditions, and the effort of
the organisms to readjust the balance thus
disturbed has led to evolution. Thus to
some extent at least the characters of organisms
can be explained by the nature of their
surroundings. A further interest is added
by the fact that in this respect human societies
and settlements can be shown to behave
like organisms. Therefore we can hope to
explain at least partially the manifold differences
in man and his societies in different
parts of the globe by the minor differences in
physical conditions. In other words, the
doctrine of evolution has added a unifying
and co-ordinating principle which has not
only prevented geography from being crushed
by the enormous recent increase in known
facts, but has also for the first time raised it
to the level of a science.</p>

<p>This addition of a co-ordinating principle
may be said to be the direct effect of the
publication of the <i>Origin of Species</i>, but
there has been an indirect effect almost as<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></a>
important. The principles enunciated in
that book had a stimulating effect, not upon
one science only but upon every department
of thought. Phenomena of no importance
suddenly became interesting, and the result
of this interest was an enormous addition to
known facts. Not only has research been
stimulated in every direction, but as this
research has been largely directed by the
desire to discover the interrelation of phenomena,
we find that many of the old barriers
between the sciences are breaking down.</p>

<p>The botanists are no longer content to
study the facts of plant distribution; they now
want to be able to give reasons for particular
distributions. Therefore they must seek the
aid of the meteorologists to explain differences
of climate; of the physical geographer
to make clear the effects of relief, of differences
of soil, and of drainage; of the cartographer
to represent the facts which emerge
from their surveys, and so on. The physician
must now seek the assistance of the zoologist
before he can deal adequately with tropical
disease, and the zoologist must have the
help of the physical geographer before he
can give adequate aid. The result is that
in all directions geography is being enriched<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></a>
by facts brought from the collateral sciences,
while at the same time its position as a
central unifying science is becoming more
and more established; as a science which can
deal with all these varied facts, but deal
with them from a standpoint peculiarly its
own.</p>

<p>At the present time, geography may be
compared to one of Rodin’s statues in
which we see a beautiful figure as it were
struggling to escape from the marble in which
it is imprisoned. So the geography of to-day
is in the act of escaping from the matrix of
mere facts in which it has been too long
imprisoned. It is now displaying itself as
a great unity in the making of which all the
sciences have played their part.</p>

<p>But even in this general survey of recent
developments two other sets of facts must
be touched upon. We have given fifty years
as the period within which most of what is
distinctively modern in geography has developed.
It must not be forgotten that
within the same period there has been a
remarkable renewal of interest in geographical
exploration. Roughly speaking, within
this period Africa has ceased to be an unknown
continent; the innermost recesses of<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></a>
Asia have been largely explored; the Arctic and
Antarctic areas have yielded many, though
by no means the whole, of their secrets; a
great deal of exploration has been done in
America as a whole, as well as much detailed
survey work in the United States and Canada;
the oceans have been investigated by successive
series of expeditions. Generally it may
be said that in its broad outlines our knowledge
of the world has been completed, so
that geographical science is free to pass from
the mere collection of raw material to the
higher task of arranging, classifying, and
making deductions, as well as to the more
detailed surveys which are still necessary.</p>

<p>The other point of interest is that the last
fifty years have seen an enormous increase
in the facilities for travel, a fact which has
led to a great increase in the number of
people to whom geography appeals. The
decade between 1830 and 1840 saw the beginning
of two great series of guide-books,
Murray’s <i>Handbooks</i> and Baedeker’s <i>Guides</i>,
whose importance for the travelling public
can hardly be over-estimated. The first
“Baedeker” was a little guide to the Rhine,
and since it was first published this firm of
publishers has not only extended its field of<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></a>
operations over nearly the whole world,
but has issued a constant stream of new
editions, which for the most frequented
tourist regions are practically annual. That
great tourist agency whose name is now a
household word began operations in the early
forties, and like the firm of Baedeker has
now taken the world as its sphere of action.
We may say, then, that during the course of
the nineteenth century, travel, previously
a pastime of the rich, was brought within
the reach of very moderate purses. This
democratisation of travel is still going on,
and in certain recent visits of British working
men to Germany and elsewhere we may
perhaps see the beginning of a process
which will eventually bring some amount
of journeying abroad within the reach of
all.</p>

<p>As yet the effect upon geography of this increase
in travelling has been chiefly to enhance
popular interest in the science, rather
than to enrich it, for the vast majority of
“popular” travel books have added little, if
anything, to the sum total of knowledge. But
this is partly because geographical teaching
has hitherto been badly organised, and the
greater number of travellers have started on<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></a>
their journeys without having been taught
what to observe or how to observe. There
are already indications that this condition of
affairs is passing away, and that the traveller
of the future will start better equipped, and
will demand in his guide-books a new point
of view. Starting from a higher level he will
bring back more from his travels.</p>

<p>Meantime it should be noted that some
knowledge of the generalisations laid down
by geographers during the course of the last
half century adds enormously to the interest
of travel, both at home and abroad, and that
for this reason, if for no other, geography is
worth study by all.</p>

<p>In the following chapters we shall look,
so far as possible, at those aspects of the
subject which make the widest appeal, and
which are best fitted to enable the ordinary
man to understand his surroundings, whatever
they may be, and so aid him in that
delicate task of adjustment which, consciously
or unconsciously, is the task of every living
thing. As limitations of space involve a
similar limitation of subject-matter, it has
been thought best to lay most stress upon the
conditions which prevail in Europe and North
America, the areas which have been most<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></a>
thoroughly studied. Europe has the special
interest that it has given origin to the type
of civilisation which has most profoundly
modified the earth’s surface. This limitation
cannot, however, be made rigid, for it
is of the essence of the modern standpoint
that no area can be understood without
reference to the world at large. The geography
of Europe no less than of North
America is determined by the position of
the respective continents on the surface of
the globe, and cannot be understood without
a consideration of this position and its implications.
The standpoint adopted here is
frankly anthropological, that is, the world is
considered as the home of man, its physical
peculiarities being regarded as interesting
chiefly in their relation to man and his
activities.</p>

<p>Finally, we may note that the development
of the subject within recent years has been
such that it is quite impossible, even within
the limitations already laid down, to give
a complete survey of the subject. All that
will be attempted, therefore, is to suggest
some of the lines along which research is
proceeding most actively at the present time,
special stress being laid upon those aspects<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></a>
of the subject which are not as yet fully
treated in the smaller text-books. The list
of books of reference at the end will, it is
hoped, enable those interested to fill in the
blanks which such a scheme necessarily
leaves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>SURFACE-RELIEF AND THE PROCESS OF
EROSION</h3>


<p>It is not necessary here to consider the
various formal definitions of geography which
have been proposed in the last few years. As
is only natural with a developing subject,
much discussion has taken place as to the exact
limits of its field of action, and many definitions
have been proposed with the object of
setting forth these limits as clearly as possible.
But it is sufficient for our purpose to note that
geography deals with the surface-relief of the
earth, and with the influence which that
relief exercises upon the distribution of other
phenomena, and especially upon the life of
man. Before we proceed to study detailed
problems, then, it is obviously necessary to
look at some general points connected with
the relief of the earth’s surface and its causes.</p>

<p>In the words of the physical geographer,<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></a>
the earth’s surface consists of the solid crust,
or lithosphere, of the mass of water forming
the seas and oceans and constituting the
hydrosphere, and of that envelope of gas
which we call the atmosphere. Considered
separately, each of these is the concern of
special sciences, and not of the geographer
proper. His business it is to take the facts
furnished by the meteorologists, the physicists,
the geologists, and so forth, and with
these facts in hand to proceed to consider the
effect of the interaction of earth and water
and air in a way which the separate sciences
cannot do. We must further note that it is
the interactions of these three which make
the earth a possible home for life as we know
it, and it is these interactions therefore which
influence the distribution of life on the surface
of the globe.</p>

<p>There may have been a period when the
crust of the earth was clothed in a uniform
sheet of water, just as the globe is now
enveloped in a complete covering of air, but
at present, as through the long ages of geological
time, the lithosphere consists of elevations
and hollows, and it is in the hollows that
the water accumulates, so that we can distinguish
between the dry land and the ocean<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></a>
beds. Both chemically and physically the
fluid hydrosphere differs markedly from the
solid lithosphere, and it is, above all, the
physical differences which are of supreme
importance to the geographer. Because of
them sea and land respond differently to the
stream of solar energy which pours down upon
our globe, and it is this different response
which is the predominating factor in the
production of the different climates, which
again determine in its main outlines the distribution
of living organisms.</p>

<p>This being so, it is clear that it is of great
importance to the geographer to know exactly
the distribution of land and water over the
surface of the earth. As the North Polar
regions are still inadequately known, and the
South Polar regions hardly known at all, we
cannot as yet determine exactly this distribution,
but any globe will show that land and
ocean are very unequally distributed. The
great land masses cluster round the North
Pole, while the southern hemisphere consists
largely of water. We thus have a land
hemisphere and a water one. According to
recent calculations the oceans occupy some
72 per cent. of the entire surface of the globe,
leaving only 28 per cent. of land. But while<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></a>
in the northern hemisphere there is about one
and a half times more water than land, in the
southern there is about six times more water,
both figures being liable to error, as indicated
above, owing to our uncertainty as to the
land and water of the Polar zones.</p>

<p>This distribution is of great importance in
connection with certain theories as to the
actual plan of the earth, but this is a difficult
subject which need not concern us here.
It is discussed in Prof. J. W. Gregory’s
volume on <i>The Making of the Earth</i>.
More interesting is the effect which the
arrangement of land and water has had upon
that part of the life of the earth which was
evolved in late geological time. Though
the geographer for convenience’ sake recognizes
three separate continents in the Old
World&mdash;Europe, Asia and Africa&mdash;yet these
form practically one land mass, which in its
turn approaches America very nearly at
Bering Straits, and, less nearly, in the
North Atlantic through the intervention of
the British Isles, the Faeroes, Iceland, Greenland,
etc. The centre of this land mass
lies in Europe, a point not without its
importance.</p>

<p>In this great land mass of the northern<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></a>
hemisphere life has reached its highest degree
of development, both as regards animal form
and as regards human societies. It was in
the northern hemisphere that the highest
mammals, the placentals, arose. There are
many remarkable resemblances between the
faunas of Europe, of Asia and of Africa,
and a similar, if less marked, resemblance
between those of North America on the
one hand and of Europe and temperate Asia
on the other. On the other hand, the
two great land masses which occur in the
southern hemisphere, South America and
Australia, show very marked differences in
their fauna, both from each other and from
the northern land masses, and in both cases
the fauna has a primitive aspect, which is best
marked in Australia.</p>

<p>When we come to consider man, somewhat
similar conditions present themselves. The
great civilisations developed in the land mass
of the Old World, though the waterless desert
of the Sahara cut off much of Africa from
participation in them. America developed a
relatively high civilisation of its own, but as
the icefields and ice-pack of the north formed
a greater barrier to the migrations of man
than to those of the northern animals, this<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></a>
American civilisation was for long cut off from
that of the Old World, and when free communication
became possible, it went down
before that of the eastern world.</p>

<p>We must connect these facts directly with
the peculiar distribution of land and water
in the northern hemisphere, which made free
intercourse possible, alike for the land animals
and for man. The importance of this intercourse
may be suggested in a few words.
When a group of organisms is limited, from
whatever cause, to a particular zone of the
earth’s surface, the members of the group
tend to acquire characters fitting them for
this restricted area. But if the area is
open, constantly or periodically, to incursions
of organisms from adjacent areas,
then, with the widening of the environment,
and the greater intensity of the struggle
for existence, evolution is quickened and new
characters appear. The men of the Eurasian
continent learnt, on the fierce battle-grounds
of that continent, lessons which enabled them
to conquer without difficulty the more isolated
human groups of the southern hemisphere.
The fact that they took south with
them the mammals of the north, who also
have thriven at the expense of the native<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></a>
forms, shows that the hold of the southern
animals upon their habitat was no less precarious
than that of man himself.</p>

<p>One other point is worth notice in connection
with the distribution of land and water
over the surface of the globe. We have seen
that the northern hemisphere is the region
where organic evolution has been most
marked. It is, as it were, a great biological
laboratory. On the other hand, in the southern
hemisphere, which has fewer land masses
to interfere with the circulation of the atmosphere,
many physical phenomena occur in a
more marked and orderly fashion than to the
north. The westerly winds of the south blow
with a force and a constancy which makes it
impossible to compare them with the more
variable westerlies of the north. Even the
ocean currents of the south seem to show
more constancy than those of the north. If
the northern hemisphere is a great biological
laboratory, the southern may be described as
a physical one, and one of the great interests
of the further exploration of the Antarctic is
that it will probably cast light upon some important
meteorological problems. (See Dr.
W. S. Bruce’s volume on <i>Polar Exploration</i>.)</p>

<p><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></a></p>

<p>The distribution of land and water, with all
its effects on climate and on the distribution
of life, is, as we have seen, caused by the main
features of the relief of the earth, by the existence
of vast depressions in which the water
accumulates, and of relative elevations from
which it flows. But the minor details of
relief, hill and valley, ocean depth and continental
shelf, are also important, and exercise
a very marked effect upon distribution. They
therefore demand in their turn some consideration.</p>

<p>Taking first the prime distinction between
land surface and ocean floor, we note that the
two differ from one another markedly, alike
in their characteristics and in the conditions
to which they are exposed. The land is
subjected to constantly varying conditions:
to the alternation of day and night, and to
the changes of the seasons, with corresponding
variations in temperature; to the fluctuations
of the weather; to running water, and
so forth. In the great ocean depths at least,
on the other hand, the conditions are remarkably
uniform. Neither diurnal nor seasonal
changes have here any effect; the temperature
seems to fluctuate but little; the water
is almost still. This uniformity of physical<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></a>
conditions is reflected in the uniformity of
the surface over wide areas. While the land
surface shows marked irregularities, the ocean
floor has a monotonous character, with more
gentle outlines.</p>

<p>In its most general form the characters of
the sea bottom may be briefly stated. Round
the great land masses there is an area of relatively
shallow water, which is sometimes only
a few miles wide, and at other times extends
outwards for hundreds of miles. This region
is the <i>Continental Shelf</i>, and its seaward
boundary for convenience’ sake is taken at a
depth of 100 fathoms, or 600 feet. Within
this zone the influence of the land is still felt,
and some of the characters of land surfaces
appear. Thus we sometimes find that river
valleys are prolonged outwards over the
Continental Shelf, giving a markedly irregular
appearance to the ocean floor. The
British Islands lie upon a Continental Shelf
of this kind, and this is one of our reasons for
knowing that they are really only a part of
the continent of Europe, separated from it
by a slight depression.</p>

<p>The Continental Shelf slopes away from
the land gently, and is widest where it fringes
low continents, and narrowest where mountains<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></a>
approach the coast. Over it is spread
the waste of the land, the coarser lying near
the shore-line, the finer extending outwards
to the steep seaward slope. This rapid slope
leads down to the more or less uniform ocean
plateau, whose surface is broken by the great
ocean abysses, the greatest of which has a
depth of about six miles. Relative but not
absolute uniformity thus characterises all that
part of the ocean floor which lies below about
100 fathoms.</p>

<p>Again, though the ocean floor is doubtless
being slowly raised by the deposition upon it
of the oceanic oozes, yet it is also true that
as compared with the land surface it displays
great constancy. While the land surface is
constantly changing owing to the varying
forces which act upon it, the floor of the ocean
can vary but little from age to age, unless it is
acted upon by the internal forces of the earth.</p>

<p>Turn now to the land. We note at once the
two characters of marked irregularity of
surface, and of changeableness. The changeableness
is due to the forces of erosion which
act upon the surface, and of these forces the
most important to the geographer is running
water. It is running water, aided by other
agents, which carves the land into hill and<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></a>
valley, which produces gorge and lake, only
ultimately to fill up the lake and plane away
the gorge. It is running water which spreads
out on the lower ground the waste of the
higher, and thus prepares the way for the
operations of man.</p>

<p>The result of the long-continued action of
the varied forces of erosion must necessarily
be to reduce the surface to an almost level
condition. The denuding agents first produce
irregularities and then finally remove
these, until the whole surface is once again
almost level. The whole globe would thus
be reduced to the condition of a plain were
it not for the intervention of the internal
forces which raise up the surface anew into
folds, or which produce volcanoes and outbursts
of molten rock.</p>

<p>This constantly repeated series of changes
may be said to be chiefly the concern of the
geologist, especially as it is a series which
has repeated itself in all time. But it is to
be noted that at various parts of the surface
of the globe at the present time every stage
in the process occurs, and everywhere the
question whether a particular land area has
been exposed for a relatively long or for a
relatively short period to the forces of erosion,<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></a>
has a profound influence upon life. It
is therefore important for the geographer to
be able to recognise the different stages.
This he cannot hope to do without some detailed
knowledge of the effects of erosion.</p>

<p>Theoretically every land surface elevated
above sea-level should pass through what has
been called a cycle of erosion. There should
be a period when the active forces are working
upon a surface as yet but little modified;
this is the period called by analogy youth. At
a later stage the drainage has been well established,
and the rivers run in broad valleys,
from which lakes and waterfalls have largely
disappeared. To this condition the term
mature has been applied. At a still later
stage the land surface has been so worn by
the eroding forces that the whole process of
erosion is slackened, and an uplift must occur
before the erosive forces regain their lost
strength. This is the so-called “cycle of
normal erosion,” but it is constantly liable to
variations due to local crust movements, to
changes in climate, and to local conditions,
though at the same time the distinction of
the various stages has value for the geographer
because of their varying effects upon
human life. It is necessary for us, therefore,<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></a>
to consider how the different stages may be
recognized, and how the forces of erosion
act.</p>

<p>Let us begin our study of erosion by a
general survey of the striking features of the
earth’s surface at the present day. We know
that at various parts of the surface there rise
lofty mountain chains, whose summits are
often permanently snow-clad, and which,
from the sharpness of their forms and from
the masses of rock rubbish which are accumulating
round them, have obviously only been
exposed for a geologically short period to the
action of the atmosphere and of running
water. When examined such mountain chains
are all found to have the same peculiarities
of internal form, the rocks composing
them being elaborately folded and fractured.
Careful investigation has convinced geologists
that all the existing great chains owe their
origin to a series of earth movements which
occurred in the period <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'call'">called</ins> Tertiary, that is,
in the third of the great geological periods,
the one immediately preceding that in which
we live.</p>

<p>These lofty mountain chains of Tertiary
origin are most familiar in the great series of
folds which appear at the surface to form the<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></a>
Pyrenees, the Alps, the Caucasus and the
Himalayas, but the Atlas Mountains belong
to the same series, as does also that great
mountain chain which, under various names,
runs down the western coast of the American
continent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig_1" id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/i002.png" width="450" height="403" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;The main points in regard to the structure of
Europe. The shaded areas (1) are regions of ancient rocks,
much folded and crumpled, which once formed mountain
regions but are now mostly worn down to uplands. The lines
(2) show the regions affected by Tertiary folding, largely occupied
by mountain chains. The unshaded areas are mostly
plains and basins, only slightly affected by folding, and made
up of rocks which are often almost horizontal.</span>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></a></p>

<p>As already indicated, these areas are recognised
not only by the fact that there appear
at the surface a great number of peaks forming
a mountain chain, but also by the internal
structure, the characteristically complex
folding of the rocks. Now outside of
these recently elevated areas in, for example,
the continent of Europe, we find two conditions.
On the one hand, there are regions of
upland type but with rounded and smoothed
forms, which are sometimes almost reduced
to the condition of a plain. Such regions occur
in Ireland, in the west of Great Britain
generally, in Brittany, in the central plateau
of France, in the Ardennes, in Bohemia, in
the central plateau of Spain, in Scandinavia,
and so forth. Between these relatively elevated
areas we have plains and low-lying
river basins, such as the London basin, the
Paris basin, and so on. When the rocks
are examined in both cases it is found that in
the basins and plains the rocks, as a general
rule, are only slightly inclined, while in the
uplands and plateaux there are obvious remnants
of folding, and the rocks are of ancient
types, not relatively modern like those of the
Alps, Himalayas, etc. (see <a href="#Fig_1">fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>If, then, the existing mountain chains show<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></a>
complex folding in their constituent rocks,
and though geologically but of yesterday
have been already deeply affected by the denuding
agents, must we not suppose that the
folded and contorted uplands of Europe and
elsewhere are the last remnants of very ancient
mountain chains? It is they which
form the framework of the continents, and
by their wear and tear the low grounds have
been formed, owing to the filling in of the
great gulfs which ran between the old mountain
chains.</p>

<p>We may elaborate a little further this very
interesting subject. Let us first note that the
geologists group the rocks composing the
earth’s crust into three great divisions. We
have, first, the Primary rocks, which are the
oldest, and include as their most generally
interesting member the Carboniferous rocks,
with their coal-bearing beds, so important
in the modern industrial world. Second, we
have the Secondary beds, the most interesting
members of which is the Chalk, so well-developed
in parts of England and France.
Finally, the Tertiary series includes the rocks
of the period immediately preceding that in
which the first undoubted remains of man
occur.</p>

<p><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></a></p>

<p>Each of these periods was of enormous
length, and the labours of successive generations
of geologists have brought to light, at
least in broad outline, the general appearance
of the globe in so far as affected by the distribution
of land and water, and the main earth
movements, in each separate period. Thus
we know that during that long period of
time which is included in the Primary epoch,
very extensive earth movements, resulting
in extensive folding and mountain formation,
took place. The geologists distinguish no less
than three separate periods of folding in Primary
times. It is not necessary for us to consider
these in detail; their total result was to
produce the mountain regions whose worn-down
stumps now form those uplands which
we have described in Europe. But they do
not occur in Europe alone. That vast and
relatively infertile area in Eastern Canada
which geologists call the Canadian Shield is
a region of very old rocks, once folded into a
mountain region, but long since worn down
to an upland. In the eastern United States
that long, but interrupted, range of hills,
which, under various names, runs from the
mouth of the St. Lawrence to Alabama and
Georgia, and partially shuts the seaboard off<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></a>
from the prairies and plains beyond, is a region
where the folding is still well marked, in spite
of long denudation.</p>

<p>The Secondary period seems to have been
one in which comparatively little folding took
place, while, as already indicated, the Tertiary
was one in which there was enormous
folding in almost all parts of the globe, the
result being the appearance at the surface of
the great mountain chains of the present day.
The structure of these chains makes them
relatively unstable, and the forces of erosion
are now acting upon them with extraordinary
activity, beginning that process of wearing
down which has reduced their prototypes
of the Primary period to mere remnants of
their former greatness.</p>

<p>Extensive as the Tertiary folding was,
however, it left great areas unaffected, or but
slightly affected, and such areas form plains
or basins, where the rocks are but slightly
tilted, or show a very simple form of folding.
In Europe such slightly modified rocks occur,
<i>e. g.</i> in the Paris basin, and in the fertile plains
of south-eastern England.</p>

<p>In the United States beds of a similar
character occur right over the great plains,
filling what seems once to have been a great<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></a>
gulf between the old highlands to the east and
the towering modern mountain chains of the
west.</p>

<p>It must be realised that this is only a very
summary and partial account of a difficult and
complicated problem; but from the standpoint
of pure geography it seems desirable to distinguish
between those remnants of ancient
mountains which form the backbone of the
continents, the recently elevated mountain
chains where enormously rapid erosion is
taking place, and the largely unmodified rocks
which often form fertile plains.</p>

<p>Let us next proceed to consider how the
eroding agents act upon the surface of the
land as soon as it is exposed. We may begin
with the effect of running water upon a recently
exposed surface, <i>e. g.</i> upon land slowly
emerging above sea-level, or even with the
effect of heavy rain upon sloping ground unprotected
by a covering of vegetation. Alike
in the one case and in the other the first effect
is the formation of a number of shallow rills,
which at first run parallel to one another.
Sooner or later, however, these parallel channels
tend to converge, and a torrent is formed
such as may be seen in any mountain region.</p>

<p><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_2" id="Fig_2"></a>

<span class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;An ideal profile of a mature river (AC), showing the
increase in the slope towards the source. The dotted line BC
shows an earlier stage, when there are smooth reaches and
rapid reaches with waterfalls, etc. Note that progressive
erosion causes the source to retreat (<i>i. e.</i> from B to A).</span>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_3" id="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/i003_b.png" width="400" height="138" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;An actual profile of the Loire. It will be noted that
the Loire is a mature river, its profile nearly coinciding with
the &quot;ideal&quot; condition. (After de Martonne.)</span>
</div>

<p>Such a torrent consists of three often well-defined
parts. First we have the numerous
tiny rills which collect together to form what
the French physiographers call a receiving
basin (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bassin de réception</i>); then there is the
stream proper forming a canal which drains
the basin, while below, where the torrent<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></a>
debouches on the low ground, we find that
it spreads out fanwise and throws down
its load of débris to form a cone (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cône de
déjection</i>). The torrent therefore already
imitates a full-grown river, with its threefold
division into mountain track, valley track,
and plain track. It further illustrates the
twofold work of the river, that of erosion and
deposition.</p>

<p>Observation on an unprotected surface
after a heavy rainfall will illustrate another
point which is of much interest in connection
with the work of rivers. This is that the
water has most excavating power, not, as
might be supposed, in the collecting basin,
but in the valley region, where the slope is
still great, where the volume of the water is
at its maximum, and where it has acquired a
load of débris by means of which it carves out
its bed. The excavation of the bed therefore
proceeds from below upwards towards the
collecting basin. The result is that the slope
of the valley floor diminishes as we pass from
the upper region to the lower, owing to the
levelling effect of erosion. The process of
levelling down cannot be carried beyond a
certain point, the so-called base level of erosion,
which in a lateral stream is determined<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></a>
by the point of junction with the main stream,
and in a main stream by the point which
marks sea or lake level, for obviously no
point in the river valley can be worn down
much below its mouth.</p>

<p>When the work of a river is completed, the
line which marks the profile of its bed should
have a gentle and continuous slope downwards
to base level. The existence of irregularities,
of breaks in the smoothness of the
slope, means that the work of excavation has
not proceeded far, that the river is young.
But it is not necessary to proceed to the
laborious drawing of a profile in order to determine
the extent to which the process of
excavation has been carried. The existence
of rapids, of waterfalls, the alternation of
swift and slow-flowing reaches are all proofs
that it has not been carried far. In short, if
a river is navigable, the navigable reach at
least is mature; if it is capable of furnishing
power, that region at least is youthful. If,
as sometimes happens, the middle course is
navigable and slow-flowing, and the lower
course broken by rapids and falls, then the
probability is that earth movements have occurred,
so that the two regions are of different<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></a>
age. This is a condition which occurs
relatively often in the case of large rivers.</p>

<p>One other point is worth notice, because it
illustrates another way in which the analogy
of youth and maturity holds good. The
youthful river, with its interrupted slope, its
lakes and falls, does not permit the water to
flow off with the same regularity as the mature
river with its smoothed outlines. The
mature river is thus a more perfect instrument
of drainage.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for our purpose to consider
in detail the characteristic forms of
river erosion. It may be sufficient to notice
that rapids and waterfalls are due to the
varying hardness of the rocks forming the
bed of the river, and that the normal course of
events is the transition from waterfall to
rapid, and from rapid to stream flowing
quietly at the bottom of a rocky gorge. Long
gorges or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'canons'">canyons</ins> tend to occur in regions
where river erosion is not greatly assisted by
the other eroding agents. As a general rule,
as the river cuts its way down, the other
agents cut back the walls so exposed, so that
a wide valley is formed.</p>

<p>But a river does not only eat out its bed in
its valley track. A necessary consequence of<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></a>
this erosion is that it is also able to eat back
the slope on which it is rising, as a result of
the smoothing out of the curves of its bed, so
that its source retreats further and further
into the mountain. In regions of abundant
rainfall every slope is abundantly supplied
with streams, and therefore those streams
which cut back their region of origin most
rapidly will necessarily encroach upon their
neighbours’ territory. They therefore tend
to tap some of the tributaries of the other
streams, a phenomenon which has sometimes
considerable human importance, and has
been extensively studied of late years under
the name of river-capture.</p>

<p>Some examples may serve to make the phenomenon
clear. Every one who has travelled
up the Rhone valley in Switzerland has
noted the enormous number of lateral streams,
of all sizes, which tumble down the mountain
sides into the Rhone. These streams on, <i>e. g.</i>,
the south side, are, roughly speaking, parallel
to each other, and to a large extent enter
the main stream independently. That is, for
the most part they are very youthful streams.
In some cases, however, <i>e. g.</i> in the case of the
Dranse and the Visp, the drainage is of a
more advanced character, and we find a large<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></a>
stream with tributaries of considerable size
as distinct from mere torrents. A glance at
any great river system on the map, <i>e. g.</i> the
Mississippi, the Amazon, etc., will show that
the condition of a great stream with many<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></a>
tributaries is normal in a district where the
drainage is of the developed type. How are
the two conditions, that of numerous parallel
mountain torrents and that of a great river
system, related to one another? There is
no doubt that capture, the encroachment of
one stream upon the territory of another, has
played an important part in the process.</p>

<div class="figcenter-c" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig_4" id="Fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/i004.png" width="600" height="378" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Sketch-map to illustrate river-capture.</span>
</div>

<p>A very simple example of this widespread
phenomenon may be taken in illustration.
The accompanying <a href="#Fig_4">sketch-map</a>, drawn by
Mr. Lionel Hinxman, shows part of the
course of the River Feshie, one of the tributaries
of the Spey, and part of the Geldie
Burn, one of the tributaries of the Aberdeenshire
Dee. It will be noted that the Feshie
shows a very curious bend, or elbow. Mr.
Hinxman points out that this curious condition
can be explained on the supposition that
the River Eidart, shown on the map to the
north of the bend, once formed the headwaters
of the Feshie, which cut its valley
back until it captured the headwaters of the
Geldie, and thus brought water which formerly
flowed into the Dee into the Spey valley.
The boundary between the two counties of
Aberdeen and Inverness is shown on the map
by a dotted line, and it is seen that the march<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></a>
follows the watershed, which between the
present Geldie and the bend on the Feshie is
very low. Formerly, however, this watershed
lay much further to the west, and its
shifting is due to the capture.</p>

<p>A careful study of large scale maps will
show many examples of similar river-capture,
some old and some recent. A sharp bend,
the so-called elbow of capture, on a river in
close proximity to another stream affords in
itself a certain presumption that capture has
taken place, though this presumption can
only be verified by study on the spot.</p>

<p>It may be noted that before the capture is
finally accomplished there may be an intermediate
stage when the water has the choice
of two channels, both of which may be utilised
in a time of flood. A very curious case is that
of the Casiquiare, a river in South America
which connects together the two systems
of the Amazon and the Orinoco, while another
is the connection recently discovered
by Captain Lenfant, a French explorer, between
the systems of the Shari and the Niger
in Africa. Such conditions are obviously unstable,
for one stream must sooner or later
predominate over the other, and deprive it
even of flood water.</p>

<p><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></a></p>

<p>Another example may help to explain the
evolution of a complex river system with
many tributaries. A glance at the map of
England (see <a href="#Fig_5">diagram</a>) shows that while the
rivers of Northumberland and Durham flow
independently into the sea, those of Yorkshire
are united into a characteristic bunch,
and all reach the ocean by means of the
Humber. This estuary breaks through the
high ground formed by the Wolds of Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire, which consists of hard
rock. At one time it is probable that the rivers
of Yorkshire entered the sea separately,
while the other great factor of the Humber,
the Trent, mingled its waters with the present
Witham. At this time the weathering of the
land surface had not reached its present stage
so the land would lie higher. In what is now
the vale of York the rocks are much softer
than where the Wolds now stand, and the
present Ouse, which was at first a longitudinal
tributary of a transverse stream, eating its
way back through these soft rocks, tapped
successively the streams flowing eastwards
from the Pennines, and with the help of the
abundant water so obtained was enabled to
cut out the wide estuary of the Humber.</p>

<p><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></a></p>

600 feet.</span>
</div>

<p>One other important point in connection
with river-capture has been already suggested
in the account given of the Feshie. In the
little sketch-map we see clearly the shift of
the watershed to the east. The ultimate
cause of this shift is doubtless the fact that in<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></a>
Great Britain the rainfall diminishes to the
east, so that, generally speaking, the westerly
streams have more erosive power than the
easterly. But the special interest of the case
is simply that it may serve to suggest a fact
not at first sight obvious, which is that water-partings
are excessively unstable features.
One set of streams is continually striving to
encroach upon the others, and by capturing
their headwaters to reduce their erosive
power. A very striking example of capture
on the large scale is seen in southern Patagonia,
where the water-parting does not lie
near the summit of the chain of the Andes,
as might be expected, but considerably to the
east, the western streams (or glaciers) having
captured all the headwaters of the eastern
streams, which lie in a region of much lower
rainfall.</p>

<p>The net result is that running water not
only scours valleys in the sides of mountain
chains, but also, sooner or later, wears away
the crest itself, and with the assistance of the
other agents of denudation tends to reduce
the mountains to plains&mdash;or at least “peneplains.”
The deduction is, of course, old
enough, but the recent emphasis placed upon
river-capture helps us to realise it, showing<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></a>
us the actual “shift of the divide,” or, in other
words, the wearing down of the summit
levels.</p>

<p>This is a theoretical matter, but there is
another point which has practical significance.
Referring once again to the sketch-map on
<a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>, we note that just at the sharp bend in
the Feshie, that is, at the elbow of capture,
there is a narrow region, crossed by the
boundary line, which was once traversed by
the headwaters of the Geldie, but is now
a dry valley. Such “gaps,” as they are
called, are present where recent capture has
occurred, and where they occur in hilly
country they sometimes form useful passes,
permitting the construction of an easy road
across the hills. A good example is the Aire
Gap (see <a href="#Fig_5">fig. 5</a>) in the Pennine range of Great
Britain, apparently connected with the fact
that the Ribble has captured the headwaters
of the Aire. Another interesting example
is the so-called Tyne Gap, that breach in the
Pennines which occurs near the present
head of the South Tyne; it was traversed
by the Roman wall, and is now crossed by
the road and the railway from Newcastle to
Carlisle.</p>

<p>As we shall see, ice appears to have this<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></a>
power of cutting passes through mountain
chains to a much greater extent than running
water; but here, as in many other respects,
there does not appear to be a sharp breach
between the action of the two.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>ICE AND ITS WORK</h3>


<p>In the last chapter we have spoken of the
moulding of the surface of the earth by means
of running water and the agents summed up
in the term “weathering.” The process is
sometimes called “normal erosion,” to distinguish
it from that other form of surface
moulding in which ice and frost play a prominent
part. At the present time ice, in the
form of ice-sheets or glaciers, is confined to
relatively small areas of the globe, so that we
are justified in regarding its action as exceptional
when compared with the work of
running water. It is, however, well known
that this limitation of the field of action of
ice is very recent, and that during a period
which geologically is only yesterday, a much
greater part of the surface than at present
was ice-clad.</p>

<p><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"><span class="pagenum">[52]</span></a></p>

<p>In point of fact, much of Europe, especially
the northern parts and those regions which
lie close to the lofty mountain chains, much
of North America, and, probably, considerable
parts of the southern hemisphere, were
subjected to the action of ice so recently
that the processes of normal erosion have not
had time to obliterate, hardly even to blur,
the tracks which the ice left.</p>

<p>The results of the great extension of ice
action in that period which geologists call
Pleistocene were twofold. In the first place,
as the result of the presence of the ice-sheet,
we have vast accumulations of débris spread
over the lower grounds. These accumulations
sometimes form great sheets of boulder
clay; sometimes they are collected into the
curious sandy and gravelly mounds called
kames which in parts of, <i>e. g.</i> Scotland, have
a great extension; sometimes they have
formed great heaps of material at the entrances
of valleys. Again, these deposits have sometimes
blocked valleys and so formed lakes,
and they have supplied the post-glacial
rivers with a vast amount of material which
has been used to scour out the river-beds,
and has been often re-sorted and re-arranged
by running water.</p>

<p><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></a></p>

<p>Secondly, the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'facts'">fact</ins> that the northern region
and the high grounds further south, in both
Europe and North America, have been recently
clad in ice is associated with many
peculiarities of surface form, some of which
have exercised a marked influence on human
settlements and ways of communication.</p>

<p>These peculiarities of surface moulding
have been the object of singularly detailed
study in late years, and from this detailed
study many interesting facts have emerged.
It may be well to state at once that this study
has been largely stimulated by the fact that
there is at present a great want of unanimity
of opinion as to the exact cause of these
peculiarities of form. According to one school
ice is a more powerful eroding agent than
water; according to another its action is
largely conservative, and its power of erosion
is slight as compared with that of water.</p>

<p>The beginnings of a possible solution of
the problem are perhaps to be seen in the
suggestions of those who seek the causes of
the peculiar features of glaciated regions in
the way in which running water works
when it is controlled and modified by the
existence of ice; but we must admit that, on
the whole, the conflict is still hot and many<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></a>
members of the opposing schools will have
no compromise.</p>

<p>To the geographer, however, the very
fierceness of the controversy has been useful.
The question as to the exact part played
respectively by water and by ice in surface
moulding is really a question for the geologist.
It is, however, of great importance to
the geographer that recently glaciated surfaces
should be studied from every point of view,
for from this detailed study are emerging
many important generalisations. We shall,
therefore, in this chapter only touch very
lightly upon the actual points in dispute,
but shall lay stress upon the interesting facts
admitted by both parties.</p>

<p>When the conception of a just-vanished
period of great glaciation was being established
by the labours of many geologists,
stress was naturally laid upon the obvious
resemblances between parts of, <i>e. g.</i> Scotland
and Wales, and those parts of the Alps which
have been exposed by the retreat of the existing
glaciers. Thus we find that most of
the text-books emphasise the occurrence of
perched blocks, of erratics, <i>i. e.</i> of blocks of
rock which must have been carried from a
distance, of the phenomenon of crag and tail,<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></a>
of giants’ kettles, and so on. All these are
of more geological than geographical importance;
they do not in themselves greatly
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'effect'">affect</ins> the distribution of other phenomena
over the surface. We shall not, therefore,
stop to consider them in detail. It is otherwise
with those indications of recent glaciation
which have been studied within the last
few years, and they demand the geographer’s
most careful consideration.</p>

<p>The most active discussion has taken place
in regard to the peculiar features of the
valleys in recently-glaciated districts, and
we shall discuss especially this point.</p>

<p>We have already described the general
features presented by valleys which owe
their origin to running water. In such
valleys, as we have seen, the longer the forces
work the more nearly is the valley floor
reduced to an even slope, whose angle decreases
in passing from the mountain to the
plain track. In the ordinary river valley
the shape of the valley approximates to that
of a V, that is, the valley narrows downwards,
the river occupying the narrowest
region.</p>

<p>Again, as a general rule there is no great
difference of level between the tributary<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></a>
valleys&mdash;at least at their extremities&mdash;and
the main valley, that is, there is no sharp
discordance between the two. While, however,
the “mature” river valley shows a
gentle, continuous slope, we usually find
that “young” rivers, at least in their mountain
track, show an alternation of plain and
gorge, which is very easily observed in any
hilly region.</p>

<p>In other words, we find that, owing to the
inclination of the rocks, or to their varying
hardness, or to other causes, particular
reaches are less easily eroded than others.
These form waterfalls, which ultimately, as
we have seen, give place to gorges. Beyond
the waterfall the diminishing slope checks
the rapidity of flow, and the stream tends to
widen out, and also to throw down its load
of débris, so that an alluvial plain may be
formed.</p>

<p>One other character of an ordinary river
valley may be noted. It heads, as we have
seen, in a collecting basin, which receives
the surface runnels and the outflows of the
springs which form the beginning of the
river.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the valleys in a recently
glaciated country. We omit any description<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></a>
of existing glaciers; these will be found described
in the volume on the Alps, and further,
photography and the picture postcard have
rendered the main features of a glacier
familiar to every one. Almost every large
railway station now shows fine coloured
photographs of some of the important Swiss
glaciers.</p>

<p>Taking, then, a valley known to have been
occupied by a Pleistocene glacier, we find
the following features. As contrasted with
an ordinary river valley, the glacial valley
is usually flat-bottomed, a condition described
as U-shaped to point the contrast
with the river valley. Examples in Great
Britain and elsewhere are frequent, but some
of the Alpine valleys show the phenomenon
in a very striking form. Two good examples
are the Aar valley at Meiringen, and the
Lauterbrunnen valley at the village of the
same name. Both have been rendered more
or less familiar by constant photographing
(see <a href="#Fig_7">fig. 7</a>).</p>

<p>The reason why they have been so much
photographed leads us to consider another
peculiarity of the glaciated valley. In both
the cases named a steep cliff wall rises from
either side of the broad, flat valley floor,<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></a>
and from the summit of this cliff the lateral
streams leap into the main valley by often
superb waterfalls. This is a very important
feature of glaciated valleys&mdash;the fact that
their tributaries are markedly <i>discordant</i>,
that is, that there is marked difference
of level between the beds of the side and
main streams.</p>

<p>Because the side valleys lie high above
the main they are said to “hang,” and are
called hanging valleys, while the main valley
is said to be over-deepened. The rocky
height over which the water springs may be
called the junction step, as an attempt to
translate the French term <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gradin de confluence</i>
which is applied to it.</p>

<p>Incidentally we may note that in the Alps
the junction step is of great human importance.
Its presence gives the water the power
which is used in lighting the Alpine villages
with electricity, and in driving the trains
which often carry the tourist to those villages.
In the French and Italian Alps especially,
the power is being more and more used to
supply the motive force for various minor
manufactures, notably for the production of
nitrogenous manure from the air.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;A diagrammatic cross-section of a recently glaciated
valley. AB, the mountain slope which rose above the ancient
glacier and has therefore retained the sharp, unrounded forms

CC shows the probable form of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'preglacial'">pre-glacial</ins> valley;

</div>

<p>Associated with the hanging valleys of<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></a>
Alpine regions is the presence of a curious
shelf, shoulder, or “bench,” which frequently
lies on the top of the cliff from which the
lateral streams spring (see <a href="#Fig_6">figs. 6</a> and <a href="#Fig_7">7</a>).
Any one who has done some walking in the
Alps, must have noticed a peculiar and often
trying feature of any walk which leads
up the side of the valley. This is that the<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></a>
walk begins with a very steep ascent, where
the road or track zig-zags to and fro. After
this steep and trying climb the walker reaches
a broad shelf (BC in figs. 6 and 7), where
the slope is much less, and where the extent
of relatively level ground gives room for the
erection of a huge hotel, or perhaps only of
a group of chalets. This shelf is covered
with fine herbage, destined to be cropped by
the cows of the community.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig_7" id="Fig_7"></a>

<span class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;An actual cross-section of the Lauterbrunnen valley.
The vertical and horizontal scales are the same. B marks the
edge of the cliff wall over which the streams leap in cascades. A
is the position of the stream at the bottom of the U-shaped
valley. BC marks the position of the shelf, largely occupied by
the pastures or alps. Above them are rocky, unsmoothed
slopes.</span>
</div>

<p>If the traveller continue his walk he will
find that above this pasture ground or <i>alp</i>
the slopes are again steep up to the mountain
summits. Possibly, however, his walk has
been to see a famous waterfall from above,
and he will find that the streams which<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></a>
flow with relative slowness over the comparatively
gentle slopes of the alp or shelf,
will at some point tumble over the region up
which he climbed, probably in a series of
leaps or cascades.</p>

<p>The U-shaped valley, the “hanging” tributaries,
the shelf or shoulder running along
the upper part of the cliff wall which bounds
the main valley, all these are striking features
of glaciated regions. We shall not here discuss
the probable causes of this striking
“break of slope,” so different from the characteristically
continuous slopes of an ordinary
mature river valley. As has been indicated,
it is here that active controversy rages.
It is, however, important to note that the
shoulder or bench of which we have spoken
was almost certainly once covered by the
ice, its gentle slope indicating the original
valley floor, before over-deepening took place.</p>

<p>The reason why pasture now grows upon
it is that it is covered with fine glacial débris,
which makes fertile soil. The fertile soil,
which is often irrigated by milky water from
existing glaciers, combined with the effect
of altitude upon the plants, produces rich
pasturage, and makes cattle-rearing an important
alpine industry.</p>

<p><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"><span class="pagenum">[62]</span></a></p>

<p>The next interesting feature of glaciated
regions is the occurrence of those curious
mountain forms which have special names
in nearly every recently-glaciated region.
Those gigantic arm-chair-shaped notches,
high up on the mountain sides, which the
Welsh call cwms, the Scotch corries, the
French cirques, and the Germans kare, are
very widespread in the Highlands of Scotland,
in the mountains of Wales, in the Tyrol,
and in other parts of the Alps (though they
are not common in the Central region), and
in North America as well as elsewhere.</p>

<p>A cirque (<a href="#Fig_8">fig. 8</a>) is shaped something like
an office arm-chair. The floor has only a
gentle downward slope, and often lodges a
lake; or in other cases it is marshy, showing
that a lake was once present. The back
and sides are steep and precipitous. In
some instances, if several cirques occur near
together, the side walls may be eroded
through, so that a shelf is produced, as one
might produce a bench by putting two chairs
side by side, and cutting away the contiguous
arms. Very often, as one may easily see in the
Highlands of Scotland, a series of cirques
occur, one above the other, so that a climber
proceeding from the valley floor upwards has<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></a>
a succession of steep “pitches,” to use a
mountaineering term, alternating with easy
if wet walks across the floors of the successive
cirques.</p>

<div class="figcenter-c" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig_8" id="Fig_8"></a>
<img src="images/i008.png" width="450" height="387" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;Diagram showing two glacial cirques.</span>
</div>

<p>It quite often happens in the case of high
mountains in the Alps that the topmost of
such a series of cirques still retains a glacier,
what is called a dead glacier, that is, one
which has practically ceased to move.</p>

<p>In other cases, again, we may find that<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></a>
what should be the flat floor of the cirque
has been largely eaten away, as it were, by
a huge rounded trough, which occupies what
would be the extreme front of the seat of
the arm-chair. In this trough a stream runs,
and the trough has the characteristic U-shaped
rounding characteristic of glacial
forms. Further, at the top of the wall of
the trough a bench or shelf exists, which is
obviously the remains of the old cirque
floor. In the case of all characteristic glacial
cirques, however, the special feature is that
the flat bottom of the cirque is discontinuous
with the valley below; they are not parts of
the same system of drainage. What we may
call an unconformity appears between the two
regions, more or less marked according as
running water has or has not had time to
begin the work of the removal of the unconformity.</p>

<p>The immediate human importance of these
corries or cirques is not so apparent as in
the case of hanging valleys, but they must
be mentioned, if only because of their extraordinary
abundance in glaciated regions,
and especially in Great Britain. There are
two views as to their origin, and we shall
indicate both here without making any attempt<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></a>
to decide which is the correct one.
A very full and clear statement of one position
will be found in an article by Prof. Garwood
in the <i>Geographical Journal</i> for September
1910, while previous articles by Prof.
Davis and others in this journal formulate the
opposed view.</p>

<p>To the first school the corrie is simply in
origin the collecting basin of a pre-glacial
stream, such a basin tending to acquire,
roughly speaking, a flattish bottom and
somewhat steep sides. With the onset of
the ice the floor of the basin was protected
by the ice from further erosion, while the
frost ate back the wall and so steepened it,
and the glacier carried away all débris as
it formed. At a later stage the lower part
of the glacier disappeared and only the cirque
glacier was left. It continued its protective
action, while below the powerful torrents
hollowed out a trough. This process was
perhaps repeated several times, with the
final result that the protected cirque was left
as a much-modified remnant of pre-glacial
conditions, while the valley below was powerfully
eroded by the glacial torrents. Thus
a cirque lying above an existing valley is to
be regarded as the beheaded end of an old<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></a>
valley, preserved by its ice covering, while
below the old valley has been fundamentally
modified by the scour of the glacial torrents.
On this view the sharp distinction between
the two angles of slope marks the distinction
between the work of ice (protective) and the
work of water (erosive). A series of cirques
means a succession of glacial and interglacial
periods.</p>

<p>According to the other school, for whom
ice is a more powerful eroding agent than
water, the cirque was produced by the ice,
its presence or absence, in <i>e. g.</i> the Alps,
being determined by the shape of the pre-glacial
mountains. Cirques are believed to
have been produced by the ice wherever the
form of the mountains conduced to the
accumulation of snow, and the occurrence
of a series of cirques, and of the troughs which
seem sometimes to eat into their floors, is
ascribed to the successive retreat of the great
ice-plough, <i>i. e.</i> to the action of the retreating
ice itself, and not to the water which flows
from beneath it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another striking feature of many glacial
valleys is a very marked want of continuity
in the slope of the main valley. Not only do<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></a>
the side valleys “hang” over the main
valleys, but, further, this main valley itself
often consists of relatively level reaches
alternating with rocky bars, through which
the river has sometimes later cut a gorge.
Examples of this are very frequent. The
famous gorge of the Aar above Meiringen is
a river gorge cut through a rocky bar of this
kind.</p>

<p>The Pyrenees are somewhat less familiar,
both to tourists and in the form of pictures,
but there, also, the same thing occurs. Above
the health resort of Cauterets lies the little
Lac de Gaube, whose mouth is blocked by a
rocky bar through which the little torrent
is cutting a tiny gorge. If the tourist crosses
the lake in a boat and begins to walk up the
valley above it, he will find that it has the
form of a staircase, the huge steps being
separated from one another by broad plateaux,
which are flat and swampy, and have
obviously been occupied by lakes not long
ago. Above each plateau there is a rocky
wall, almost precipitous, down which the
stream flows in cascades. In other parts of
the Pyrenees the same phenomenon occurs,
and the lakes sometimes persist, lying one
above the other in a series.</p>

<p><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig_9" id="Fig_9"></a>
<img src="images/i009.png" width="450" height="223" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Profile of the Maderaner thal in Switzerland, to
show the staircase arrangement peculiar to recently glaciated
valleys. (From Garwood.)</span>
</div>

<p>The phenomenon is so common that it
markedly affects human life in the Alps.
The “landings,” as the French call them,
usually afford good pasture ground, while
those which lie at no great elevation can be
cultivated. Further, as the ground is level
there is room for houses or even for a considerable
village. The intervening region or
step is too rocky to give level ground for
human habitations or for pasture and cultivation.
Where the river has had time to cut
a gorge, the road must leave the stream, and
can often be constructed only with difficulty.
The result is that an Alpine valley often consists
of a chain of villages, linked together<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></a>
by a difficult mule track or path. The
abundant water-power, however, makes mechanical
traction relatively easy, and we
have sometimes the curious condition that
a mule track is replaced by a railway, without
the intervention of a road fit for wheeled
traffic.</p>

<p>We need not stop to discuss the probable
cause of this step and stair arrangement,
which presents much the same problem as
the series of cirques at the head of the valley.
It is enough to indicate that according to one
group of physical geographers the flat landings
are due to the way in which the gradually
decreasing glacier protected its bed from
erosion, while the torrent which issued from
it eroded very rapidly below; according to
another school the landings are due to direct
glacial erosion. There are other observers,
again, who lay especial stress upon the modifications
of the erosive powers of running water,
due to the presence of the ice. For us it is
of interest to notice that, as has been already
indicated, the staircase effect occurs also,
though on a smaller scale, in the case of mountain
streams generally, some of which must be
post-glacial in origin. In other words, there
seems to be fundamental similarity between<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></a>
the work of ice and of water, the differences
being differences of degree rather than of
kind, and due largely to the varying fluidity
of the two.</p>

<p>There is still one other feature of glaciated
regions to which reference must be made.
This is the occurrence of peculiarly open
passes in considerable numbers across mountain
regions which have been recently glaciated.
In the geography books and in some
maps, the Alps, for example, are represented
as a great barrier, shutting off the fertile
plains of Italy from the countries of Central
Europe. But history shows that they have
never been such a barrier, and the phrase of
“splendid traitor” has been applied to the
whole mountain range, in order to emphasise
its total inadequacy as a barrier, either to
armed or to peaceful invasion.</p>

<p>Since the time of Napoleon I public attention
has been focussed upon a few great
Alpine passes, notably the Mont Cenis, the
Simplon and the St. Gothard, which are
crossed by great carriage roads, now functionally
replaced by railway tunnels beneath.
But we must not forget that in addition to
these and the other great passes there are
almost innumerable ways of crossing the Alps<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></a>
on foot, and the presence either of Hospices or
of small inns on many of the smaller passes
shows that they are constantly used at the
present time, in spite of railway tunnels
and carriage roads elsewhere. Even a pass
relatively so difficult as the Théodule, was
used by very large numbers of Italian peasants
during the time when work on the
Simplon railway made great demands on
Italian labour.</p>

<p>Any one of the passes, great or small,
shows in outline the same characters. There
is a steep ascent, often steeper on the Italian
than on the other side, then a broad, windswept,
open summit, sometimes almost level,
below which the rapid descent begins. Not
infrequently a lake, or lakes, may be found
near the summit.</p>

<p>On a smaller scale the same phenomenon
occurs in such glaciated regions as Scotland,
the relatively low connections between one
valley system and another greatly facilitating
communication, and usually carrying both
road and railway, where the latter exists.
Such connections between two drainage
systems (that is, the existence of a very low
divide between the two) only exist on a
small scale outside glaciated regions, so that<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></a>
they, with all their effects upon communications,
must be largely ascribed to ice-action.
We shall describe one case in a little detail,
with the proviso that while no one denies
the frequency of such passes in glaciated
regions, some authorities believe that their
production was due more to glacial torrents
than to the erosive action of ice itself.</p>

<p>A very pretty example is the picturesque
pass known as the Gemmi, which is traversed
only by a mule path, and connects Kandersteg,
and thus the lake of Thun and the town of
Berne, with the Rhone valley, which the path
enters at the village of Leuk. The walk proper
is, however, over at the Baths of Leuk, a small
health resort lying at the foot of the great
Gemmiwand, a wall of rock over 1,600 feet in
height on the summit of which is the Gemmi
pass. Readers of Mark Twain’s <i>A Tramp
Abroad</i> will remember his interesting description
of the crossing of the pass, which is part
of the regulation tour in Switzerland.</p>

<p>The excursion may be very briefly described.
The traveller starts from the village
of Kandersteg, and almost immediately begins
a steep climb, which after a rise of over
2,000 feet leads him over a ridge to a pasture,
once swept by an avalanche. Another short<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></a>
but steep rise (note the staircase arrangement)
leads him to the lonely Daubensee,
a little lake which is frozen for more than half
the year and has no outlet. It is itself fed
by a glacier lying to the traveller’s right,
the Laemmern glacier, which is shrinking
and exposing more and more of its old bed.
Even to the most inexperienced traveller
it is obvious that this present day shrinkage
is, as it were, the last remnant of a shrinkage
which has been going on for a prolonged
period, so that the route by which the traveller
ascended from Kandersteg is but a remnant
of the bed of the old glacier. The point of
special interest, however, is that at the end
of the Daubensee the traveller leaves the
glacial valley by which he has ascended, and
passing through a great notch or gateway in
a wall of rock, begins the almost precipitous
descent to Leukerbad, which lies at his feet,
1,600 feet below. It is this notch which
makes the pass, and it is fundamentally a
breach in the mountain wall which separates
the drainage of the Rhine from that of the
Rhone. Comparing small things with great
we may note that this gateway presents
some resemblance to the Tyne and Aire
Gaps in the Pennines, already mentioned,<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></a>
which may also have been modified by ice-action.</p>

<p>The explanation given is as follows:&mdash;At
the time when the glaciation reached its maximum
height the mass of ice in what is now the
Laemmern glacier was so great that it could
not be contained within its own valley. The
ice was piled up so high that it over-rode
the watershed, rose up beyond the containing
wall of its own valley, and pushed a
long arm over the valley wall, down into the
Rhone valley. This tongue of ice, either
by its own erosive power, or because of the
glacial and sub-glacial streams which it produced,
wore out a notch in the wall as it
crossed, and it is this notch which makes the
pass. As the glacier gradually shrank, it could
no longer send this tributary over the wall
into the valley below, and was constrained to
send all its drainage into its own valley, that
is ultimately into the Rhine. But the Gemmi
pass persists as a proof of its former magnitude,
of the fact that once part of the Laemmern
drainage reached the Mediterranean
instead of the North Sea, that there was once
a communication between the Rhine and
the Rhone drainage systems.</p>

<p>Many at least of the great Alpine passes<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></a>
are believed to have been produced in this
way, and therefore we must add to the
peculiarities of recently-glaciated countries,
the fact that passes are likely to be frequent
across their hills and valleys, owing to
the power which ice possesses, when enormously
developed, of rising above valley
walls, and streaming down into another valley
system. Some of the great Alpine passes,
perhaps, arose in other ways, but this brief
description may be of interest as suggesting
one, probably common, mode of origin.</p>

<p>If we sum up what has been said as to the
special features of glaciated regions, we may
note that their valleys tend to be U-shaped,
and to be discontinuous with their tributary
valleys, which “hang” over them. On the
top of the cliff from which these tributary
streams leap is a shelf, which is clearly a
portion of the floor of the pre-glacial valley
and is covered by glacial débris. At the
heads of the valleys there are often cirques or
plateaux, which again are markedly discordant,
hanging high above the valley below. In
the main valley itself there are similar discordances,
giving rise to a staircase arrangement.
Finally, different valley systems often<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></a>
communicate with each other by passes,
natural highways which hang high above
both valley systems alike.</p>

<p>Obviously, however, we might replace this
detailed summary by the simple statement
that whereas in a region subjected only to
the action of running water, there is a marked
tendency to continuity of slopes throughout,
a tendency more and more marked the longer
the water acts, in glaciated regions there is
an equally obvious discordance, a discontinuity
of slope, most marked where water
has not had time to begin its smoothing
action. As every glaciated valley which
we can study in detail has been subjected to
the action both of ice and of water, it is a
simple deduction that the discontinuity is
due to the differential action of the two.
This is the point of geographical importance,
and to the geographer it is of minor importance
to know whether it is the passive resistance
of the ice which has caused the
discontinuity, or whether it is the water
which has been unable to keep pace with
the activity of the ice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is one other point which must be
alluded to even in this very brief consideration<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></a>
of the effect of the ice age upon the
physical geography of the glaciated regions.
This is the fact that it greatly modified the
numbers and distribution of plants and animals
throughout the areas affected. Obviously
the covering of ice must have rendered
a large part of Europe uninhabitable both for
man and for the vast majority of animals and
plants. In Europe, therefore, as also in North
America, there must have been a southward
sweep of all living organisms, driven from
their original habitat by the onset of the cold
period. But the conditions in the two continents
differed greatly.</p>

<p>In North America, especially in the east,
there are no transverse chains of mountains,
there is no southern sea until the Gulf of
Mexico is reached in lat. 30°, and even here
Florida almost touches the tropic, and Mexico
extends far beyond it. In this continent,
therefore, the plants and animals, though
driven far to the south, still found room to
live and multiply, and had no great obstacle
to cross either in their southward journey,
or when they strove to re-annex their old
territory as the cold conditions passed away
again.</p>

<p><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"><span class="pagenum">[78]</span></a></p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the forest trees of
eastern Asia and of eastern North America
show a remarkable resemblance to one another,
and both regions are very rich in
species and in genera. It is believed that
this rich North American flora is a remnant
of pre-glacial conditions, and that its
persistence is due to the ease with which
the trees obtained an asylum to the south
during the period when the climate was most
severe.</p>

<p>In Europe, in spite of the fact that the
winter climate is much milder than in corresponding
latitudes in North America, the
number of kinds of forest trees is much less,
there is little resemblance to those of Asia
and the eastern United States, and the trees
have generally a less southern aspect. This
is the more remarkable in that trees of
southern facies introduced from China and
Japan and from the United States thrive
admirably in Europe, showing that there is
no climatic obstacle to their presence there.
To mention only a few examples, the Tree of
Heaven (<i>Ailanthus glandulosa</i>), so very common,
even as a wild tree in many parts of
the continent of Europe, was introduced from<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></a>
China, while the beautiful <i>Sophora japonica</i>,
so frequently planted in towns, comes, as
its name indicates, from Japan, and the
various species of those beautiful flowering
trees known as Catalpa are either American
or Asiatic. The western plane (<i>Platanus
occidentalis</i>), another favourite town tree,
comes from the United States, and other
American trees which are found very abundantly
in towns in the warmer parts of Europe
are the black walnut and the honey locust
(<i>Gleditschia tricanthos</i>). Perhaps more striking
than any of these is the case of the
so-called false acacia (<i>Robinia pseudacacia</i>),
which is as common over a great part of the
continent of Europe as hawthorn bushes or
wild roses are with us, and yet is a North
American species, introduced less than three
hundred years ago. Generally, we may say
that all the more beautiful trees now growing
in the warmer parts of Europe come either
from eastern Asia or from the United States.
In other words, the Ice Age seems to have
greatly impoverished the flora of Europe.
To a less extent this is also true of western
North America, which has fewer species of
trees than the east.</p>

<p><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></a></p>

<p>Why had the ice this impoverishing effect
upon Europe? The topography of the continent
supplies the answer. In the first
place, in Europe there are numerous transverse
chains of mountains. The Pyrenees,
the Alps, the Caucasus, each with its load of
ice, each with glaciers deploying on the low
ground at its feet, must have been obstacles
in the way of the southern migration alike
of plants and of animals. Again, even if
these obstacles were passed or turned, the
great inland sea formed another barrier
further south. In consequence of this difficulty
in finding asylums the pre-glacial
plants and animals must have perished in
considerable numbers, and thus a general
impoverishment took place. One must not
of course exaggerate. A proportion of the
pre-glacial forms did succeed in living through
the period of stress, but many must have
been, as it were, squeezed out of Europe or
out of existence by the unfavourable climatic
conditions.</p>

<p>As the climate improved the lands swept
bare once again became inhabitable, and
there was a recolonisation by movements
from the south and from the east. We shall<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></a>
indicate later how man himself came from
the south and the east to colonise the west
and north, but his movements were only
part of a great series which included also
those of plants and animals.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>CLIMATE AND WEATHER</h3>


<p>To the superficial observer those daily
variations in the atmospheric conditions in
any one locality which we sum up under
the term weather, may appear to occur without
order or regularity, but detailed quantitive
study soon shows that even British
weather displays constancy in its irregularity.
The existence of such basal constancy, indeed,
lies at the root of all intelligent utilisation of
the soil. The irresponsible amateur gardener
may lightheartedly assume that a particular
spring will be “early,” but the professional
is not easily induced to abandon his rule that
such and such operations must not be undertaken
before certain fixed dates. The farmer,
if he is to avoid bankruptcy, must know
within what limits the first autumn frost is<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></a>
likely to make its appearance, and when the
last spring one may be expected.</p>

<p>Collective experience, then, whether expressed
in the meteorologist’s figures or in a
less accurate form, leads us to the conclusion
that for every locality on the earth’s surface
there is a certain fixed average succession of
weather, which we sum up in the term <i>climate</i>.</p>

<p>In the case of both climate and weather our
knowledge may be summed up in such general
terms as “wet” or “dry,” “warm” or
“cold,” and so forth, or we may borrow the
meteorologist’s notations, and express the
facts in degrees of temperature, inches of
rainfall and of pressure, percentages of humidity,
and so on. But it should be understood
that such figures can be used by the
geographer with justification only when he
is himself aware, and can assume that his
audience is aware, of the significance of the
figures in connection with the processes of
erosion and the phenomena of life. To say
that the mean January temperature of a particular
place is 30° F., is only a convenient
shorthand way of saying that in this place in
winter plant life is arrested, water is ice-bound,
and most animals sleep or migrate.
In other words, the use of the figures assumes<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"><span class="pagenum">[84]</span></a>
a certain knowledge of biology and of physics
on the part of the audience.</p>

<p>We do not propose here to treat either
climate or weather with any fullness, for there
is a volume in the series specially devoted to
these and kindred subjects. All that will be
attempted, therefore, is to discuss one or two
important climates with the object of considering
later their respective effects on the distribution
of other phenomena on the surface
of the globe. This is the more worth doing in
that the subject is one which has had a great
deal of attention devoted to it in recent years.</p>

<p>Certain points in regard to climate, <i>e. g.</i>
the fact that the regions of the earth near the
equator get more solar heat than those
nearer the poles, and that parts of the globe
are subjected to variable winds, as contrasted
with those regions where the extraordinarily
regular winds called “trades” blow, have
of course been known for long enough. But
not till the latter half of the nineteenth century
did the civilised nations begin regular
meteorological observations, and these observations
are still scanty for the uncivilised
and partially civilised regions. The meteorological
raw material necessary for the exact
study of climates has thus only been available<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></a>
for a comparatively short period, and is
still incomplete.</p>

<p>We may begin with that type of climate
which has so profoundly influenced the
civilisation of western Europe, and therefore
also the new civilisations of America, Australia,
South Africa, and so on. This is
the type called Mediterranean, because it
reaches its best development and has been
most studied round the Mediterranean area.
But it also occurs in California, in parts
of Chile, in South Africa round Cape Colony,
and in south and south-western Australia.
Generally, it is characteristic of lands lying
on the western side of continents, in the
latitudes between tropical and temperate, and
is therefore sometimes called the maritime
sub-tropical climate. The term maritime is
applied because, as we shall see, for some part
of the year oceanic influences prevail, sub-tropical
indicates the position in latitude.</p>

<p>A very curious illustration of the similarity
of climate in the different regions named is
to be found in the fact that in parts of the
Mediterranean area two introduced American
plants, the agave and the prickly pear, are
more obvious and abundant than most native
plants; while in California, Cape Colony and<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></a>
southern Australia the cultivated plants are
chiefly of Mediterranean origin.</p>

<p>The main features of the Mediterranean
climate may be briefly summarised. The
most important character, next to the mild
temperature, is the fact that no rain (or very
little) falls in summer, the growing season
further north, which is here largely a period
of cessation of plant growth. The rain,
which tends to be scanty or even absent in
the interior of land masses, <i>e. g.</i> in Spain and
Asia Minor, and also to the south, <i>e. g.</i> in the
Desert of Sahara, in the Mediterranean region
proper falls in the winter months. It is this
winter rainfall and the summer drought which
define the Mediterranean type of climate.</p>

<p>The reason for this seasonal distribution
of rainfall is as interesting as the fact itself,
and to understand it we must turn to the circulation
of air on the surface of the globe.</p>

<p>In the following description we shall restrict
ourselves, for the sake of clearness, to the
Mediterranean region itself, the region where
the Mediterranean type of climate is developed
over the largest area, and where, for
many reasons, it is most important. But it
must be noted that the conditions which give
rise to the Mediterranean type of climate are<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></a>
the same wherever it occurs, though in the
Mediterranean area they are greatly modified
by the great inland sea of that name, which
carries oceanic conditions far into the
land.</p>

<p>We must note, first, that at all seasons
those regions of the earth which are directly
beneath the vertical rays of the sun are heated
most intensely. Therefore the air over these
regions, being rendered light by heating, rises,
and a belt of low pressure is thus formed.
Only at the equinoxes does this belt of high
temperature, low pressure, and light winds
or calms, coincide with the equator. In the
northern summer it moves north with the sun;
in the northern winter it travels south with
the sun, being always over what is called the
<i>heat equator</i>. Into this belt of low pressure
air from north and south, where the pressure
is greater, tends to rush in, and we have thus
formed the constant or “trade” winds,
which, owing to the deflection produced by
the earth’s rotation, appear as the north-east
trades in the northern hemisphere and the
south-east in the south. These winds are
dry winds, because they blow from colder
to warmer latitudes, and they accompany<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></a>
the equatorial low-pressure belt in its north
and south movements.</p>

<p>In the northern summer the trade winds
may extend northward to lat. 35° or even
40°, while in winter their northern limit is
10° to 15° further south. A glance at the
map, then, will show that in summer the
Mediterranean area is within or near the
sphere of action of the dry trade winds, which
are continental, sweeping into the region
after having blown over land surfaces.</p>

<p>We must next consider the atmospheric
movements in the region to the north of the
trade wind belt. An area of more or less permanent
low pressure, best marked in winter,
exists in the North Atlantic, in about 60° N.
lat., and draws the air into it in the direction
known as counterclockwise, that is, in
the direction opposite to that of the hands of
the clock. The result is the production of the
winds which appear off the coast of western
Europe as the warm south-westerly winds of
winter, while they appear off the coast of
North America as cold northerly winds. In
the southern hemisphere, where, as we have
seen, there is less land to interfere with the
development of the atmospheric circulation,
these winds form the prevailing westerlies.</p>

<p><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"><span class="pagenum">[89]</span></a></p>

<p>In the Atlantic these south-westerly winds
obviously blow in a direction opposite to the
north-east trades, whence the name of anti-trades
often given to them. As they blow
across the broad Atlantic they arrive off
Europe saturated with moisture. As they
come from lower latitudes they are warmth
bringing. In winter these winds reach the
Mediterranean area owing to the southern
shift of the trades, and bring moisture with
them; while in summer they lie more to the
north, and though their moisture affects the
coast of Portugal it does not reach the greater
part of the Mediterranean area.</p>

<p>Within that area the northern limit of the
rainless summer may be said, in a rough
sense, to correspond with about the 40th
parallel of latitude, though it varies according
to local conditions in the different peninsulas.
To the north of this line, therefore,
the climate is more or less affected even in
summer by the anti-trades.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the region
of the trade winds and of the anti-trades
lie side by side. Between the two there is a
zone of variable winds, but in general terms
we can explain the peculiarities of the Mediterranean
rainfall by saying that the region<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></a>
lies within or just at the edge of the dry trades
in summer, and within the zone of the moist
anti-trades in winter.</p>

<p>Let us next consider how the area is demarcated
from the surrounding regions.
There is of course no hard and fast line, but
we can indicate in broad outline the meteorological
limits. To take the absolutely rainless
summer as the limit would cut out, as
we have suggested above, the greater part of
the northern shore of the Mediterranean, except
the southern halves of all the great peninsulas.
Quite generally, however, we may
say that the northern limit of the Mediterranean
region, in its western half, is defined
by the occurrence of considerable summer
rain. That is, it is bounded to the north by
a region which is within reach of the rain-bringing
anti-trades in summer as well as in
winter, and which has a lower temperature
than the Mediterranean region proper. To
the east the region is limited by deserts, for
the westerlies of winter can only carry their
moisture a certain distance inwards, and
though they are greatly assisted by the long,
eastward-stretching, inland sea, yet there
comes a time when all their load of moisture
is lost, and desert conditions supervene.</p>

<p><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></a></p>

<p>To the south the desert again forms the
boundary, though here for a different cause.
North Africa behind the Atlas is permanently
within the trade-wind belt, that is, it is permanently
subjected to the action of drying
winds, and its rainfall is therefore small or nil.
Similarly in California the southern limit of
the Mediterranean zone of climate is the desert
region of Arizona, Mexico, and the north
of Lower California. A similar band of desert
separates the Mediterranean zone from the
tropical region of summer rain in the other
places where the Mediterranean type occurs.</p>

<p>This may be summed up as follows:&mdash;Defining
the Mediterranean climate only by
its rainfall, we may say that it prevails over
lands both to the north and south of that
sea, and these have all or most of their rainfall
in winter, when the winds, though typically
westerly, are often stormy and rendered
variable by local conditions. In the summer
there may be no rain at all, or, to the north,
small amounts. To the north the region
passes gradually into that colder zone where
rain occurs abundantly both in summer and
winter, while to the east and south the rainfall
diminishes greatly, and there is a gradual
transition to desert conditions. To the<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></a>
west the boundary of the region is theoretically
the ocean, but the western coastline
owes to its peculiar position a more abundant
precipitation, which makes the vegetation
of, <i>e. g.</i>, Portugal present quite a different
appearance from that of southern Italy or
Algiers. These peculiarities of rainfall the
region owes to its position between two great
wind systems, of which one gains the mastery
in winter and the other in summer.</p>

<p>So far in this discussion we have spoken
only of the distribution of the rainfall
throughout the year, but there are other
features of the Mediterranean climate which
are almost as important in considering the
effects of the climate on the life of the region.
These are the amount of the rainfall, and
the temperature.</p>

<p>Beginning with general points, it is very
important to notice that the rainfall throughout
the area as a whole is relatively scanty,
except where special conditions, <i>e. g.</i> great
elevation, or local rain-bringing winds, increase
it. Translated into terms of plant
life this means that continuous forests of the
type so characteristic of the greater part of
Europe till man interfered, are relatively rare
within the limits of the Mediterranean region.<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></a>
Looking at the same fact from the human
standpoint we may say that the rainfall is
often so scanty that irrigation is necessary
before man can prosper. These two facts,
that Mediterranean man had not to clear
forests before he planted and sowed, as the
Teutons were obliged to do, and that he had
often to bring water artificially before his
crops would grow, have been of supreme
importance in the evolution of Mediterranean
civilisation. Even at this stage it is interesting
to note that France in this, as in many
other respects, has shared in two civilisations,
for her territory to the south shows Mediterranean
characters, and elsewhere resembles
the cool temperate zone of Europe.</p>

<p>The next general point of importance is
that of temperature. As was to be expected
from its latitude the basin of the Mediterranean
is a relatively warm region. Local
conditions, and especially the presence of a
great mass of water, make the winter exceptionally
mild, while the summers, though not
excessively hot they are considerably cooler
than those of similar latitudes in Asia, are
yet warm and sunny. The result is that,
given water artificially supplied, or given<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></a>
crops which can take water from the deeper
layers of the soil, the region is productive,
the destructive frost of the north not being
a menace. This relative easiness of life in
the more favoured parts of the region has
been of great importance in its history.</p>

<p>We may give next some actual figures to
illustrate what has been said about temperature
and rainfall. Let us begin with rainfall,
and in order to have a basis of comparison
we may first note that Edinburgh has a mean
annual rainfall of about 28 inches, and London
one of about 25 inches. In other words,
when the total amount of rain which falls in
any one year is estimated for many years in
either of these places, these totals added
together and divided by the number of years
of observation, the quotient is the figure
given. The figures show that the rainfall
in London is less than that in Edinburgh,
while in Paris it is less than in either.</p>

<p>Passing now to consider the Mediterranean
area we find that, speaking generally,
the rainfall diminishes, for the reasons already
explained, in passing from west to east, and
in passing from north to south. Thus Gibraltar,
at one end of the basin has a fall of 32"<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></a>
per annum, as compared with one of 15" at
Athens near the other extremity. Genoa in
the north has the heavy fall of 51", while
Biskra in Algiers has only 8".</p>

<p>There are many local variations, due to
local causes, and in comparing the falls with
those of Edinburgh and London we must
remember that the higher temperatures mean
much greater evaporation. Sunny Naples
has about 4" more rain in the year than
Edinburgh, and has 7" more than foggy
London, but yet has not a wet climate.</p>

<p>For temperatures a few figures may suffice.
In London the mean January temperature
is 39° F., while it is only 36° F. at Paris. In
Nice the mean January temperature is 45°,
which is about the same as that of Athens,
and rather less than that of Naples. In January,
then, the temperature of Nice is only
6° higher than that of London. In July the
mean temperature at London is 62°, as against
73° at Nice and over 80° at Athens. In other
words, owing to our mild winters and cool
summers, there is far more difference between
British and Mediterranean temperatures in
summer than in winter. In the Mediterranean
region itself the difference between the<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></a>
temperatures of summer and winter increases
as we pass eastwards, so that it is especially
to the west that characteristically Mediterranean
conditions occur, <i>i. e.</i> mild, frost-free
winters, and summers which for the latitude
are not excessively hot. This feature also has
been of importance in the development of
the Mediterranean civilisations.</p>

<p>We have treated the climate of the Mediterranean
area in some detail, as an example
of the methods and results of modern
climatology. We may note much more
briefly the characteristics of one or two other
climatic provinces.</p>

<p>Mediterranean influences, expressed in
winter rains, are continued eastward into
Mesopotamia and even into Persia, the rain
always becoming scantier, and desert conditions
tending to supervene. Still further
east, however, we come to a region where the
rainfall is abundant, and where the population
is once more dense. These are the monsoon
countries, including India and China,
where the usually plentiful rainfall again permits
the land to nourish man abundantly.</p>

<p>Excluding Africa south of the Sahara from
consideration, we may indeed say that the<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></a>
Old World has two regions of abundant rainfall
and dense population, the one to the west
and the other to the south-east, separated
from each other by warm and cold deserts.
Each of these two regions has given rise to its
own civilisation, each has produced its own
types of cultivated plants and domestic
animals, and the root differences between the
two must be regarded as largely the result
of climatic conditions.</p>

<p>The monsoon countries are so named
because of the regular seasonal reversal of
the winds, which blow from land to sea in
winter and from sea to land in summer,
affording an example of a land and sea breeze
on the gigantic scale. The result is that,
subject to local modifications, the summer
winds are moisture-bringing, and the winter
winds are dry. Whereas, then, in the Mediterranean
the heat of summer is largely
wasted, from the agriculturist’s point of view,
on account of the scarcity of the water necessary
for growth, in monsoon regions, unless
the rain fail, as it sometimes does, the hot
season is the moist season, and, therefore,
other things being equal, growth must be
faster here than in the Mediterranean area.<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></a>
The monsoon countries extend over a great
stretch of latitude, and therefore temperature
conditions vary greatly, while the great
variety of surface-relief produces here abnormally
heavy rainfall, and there desert conditions.
The essential contrast with the Mediterranean
type is, however, the summer
rainfall.</p>

<p>Taking the globe as a whole we find that
summer rainfall is more common than winter,
and in addition to occurring in monsoon
regions, it tends to occur in tropical regions
generally. As we approach the equator from
the tropics we find that the total fall increases,
and tends to show two maxima, which
occur when the sun is overhead, <i>i. e.</i> at the
equinoxes. For our particular purpose, however,
the climatic conditions in tropical and
equatorial regions generally, though of great
importance to the climatologist, are not of
great interest, for except in monsoon countries
the hot parts of the earth do not show
the most highly developed human societies.</p>

<p>Let us turn next to that part of Europe
which is outside the reach of Mediterranean
influences. Here we find that the rain is
distributed throughout the year, and is usually<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></a>
abundant, though it decreases in passing
eastwards from the seaboard. Temperatures
are naturally lower than in the Mediterranean
basin, and winter frost plays an important
part in determining the choice of cultivated
plants. As the figures which we have already
quoted for London and Paris suggest, the
winter cold increases on passing eastward.
Paris is colder in winter than London, though
it lies south of it. Vienna is again colder than
Paris. But the increase in winter cold is
compensated for by an increase in the summer
heat. In other words, as the distance from
the sea increases in Europe the climate becomes
drier and more extreme.</p>

<p>This observation naturally leads up to a
consideration of the effect of the proximity
of the sea upon climate. Water heats more
slowly than land, but also cools more slowly,
and therefore the proximity of large masses
of water has, speaking generally, a moderating
influence upon climate, producing the so-called
maritime climate. In the case of the
British Isles this effect is very marked, because
the ocean to the west of us is unusually
warm, and the circulation of the atmosphere
is such that the prevailing winds of winter<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></a>
blow towards us from the warmer parts of
this ocean, while the fact that the summer
winds often have a northerly component helps
to keep the summer temperatures down.</p>

<p>The peculiar conditions of the British
Islands illustrate the fact that climate does
not depend upon latitude alone, but may be
greatly modified by local conditions, especially
by the distribution of land and water,
and the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>Let us now sum up what has been said in
regard to the main types of climate found in
Europe. Round the Mediterranean basin
we have an area with mild winters and warm
summers, where the rain tends to fall during
the winter season, making summer a period
of drought. This climate extends beyond
the limits of Europe into Northern Africa and
Western Asia, and is separated from the
regions of tropical climate, which have no
winter and have rains at the hottest season,
by a belt of desert.</p>

<p>The western seaboard of Europe has a
maritime climate, the sea tempering the
winter, but diminishing the summer heat.
The prevailing winds are westerly, and the
rainfall is typically abundant and distributed<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></a>
throughout the year. On passing inwards this
type of climate changes into the continental
type, with cold winters and hot summers, and
diminishing rainfall. Though precipitation
occurs at all seasons of the year, it tends to be
greatest in summer, giving, <i>e. g.</i> in parts of
the Balkan States, a type eminently suited
to the cereal maize, which needs more summer
rain than wheat.</p>

<p>If we bear in mind that North America is
a large continent, and Europe a very small
one, and that while Europe has no eastern
seaboard, it is the eastern seaboard of America
which faces Europe, we may realise that the
climates of North America show a remarkable
analogy to the European. On the western
side we have in British Columbia and California
respectively the same two types of
maritime climate which occur in Europe,
that is, British Columbia has a mild equable
climate with abundant and equally distributed
rainfall, and California has a Mediterranean
climate.</p>

<p>At the eastern side the conditions are a
little different, and show us that the mere
presence of the sea is not sufficient to produce
a “maritime” climate. The prevailing winds<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"><span class="pagenum">[102]</span></a>
in eastern North America are off the shore;
they cannot therefore carry oceanic influences
landwards. To the north the winds tend to
have a northerly component, and cold currents
of water also stream out of the Arctic
and chill eastern North America. The result
is that we find that Labrador, though lying in
the latitude of Great Britain, has a very
severe climate. Further south the conditions
are of the “continental” character even on
the seaboard, the winters being very cold and
the summers hot. Rainfall is equally distributed
throughout the year, but on passing
inland it diminishes in amount and tends to
be limited to the warm season. The diminution
would be much more obvious than it
actually is were it not that the existence of
the large Gulf of Mexico, and also the size of
the North American continent, give rise in
the south to a monsoon effect, which greatly
increases the rainfall of the south-eastern
corner of the States. Further to the west,
in the lee of the great barrier of the Rocky
Mountains, the rainfall is slight.</p>

<p>Incidentally, we may notice that the eastern
seaboard of the great Eurasian continent
also has a more extreme climate than the<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></a>
western, offering in this respect an analogy to
the conditions which prevail on the eastern
and western halves of temperate North
America. The cause in both cases is the
same&mdash;the direction of the prevailing winds.</p>

<p>We cannot close this chapter without some
reference to weather, a subject of more
geographical importance than is generally
realised. In speaking of climate we have
used figures which were invariably <i>means</i>, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: added italic markup"><i>i. e.</i></ins>
have been obtained by averaging a great
number of observations. But where a great
number of mean figures are used in a discussion,
it is always found that the different
averages are based upon varying numbers of
observations, and are therefore not strictly
comparable with one another. There is
always a risk that such figures may mask
facts of real geographical importance. No
doubt some of the difficulties will disappear
with the progress of meteorological science,
which will enable the geographer only to
select figures which are strictly comparable.
Meantime, however, observations for long
periods are rare, and the meteorologist must
be content to take the figures which are available.
For this reason as well as for others, it<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></a>
is advisable to add to the somewhat abstract
study of means, that is, of climate, some note
upon the actual conditions, that is, upon
weather.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_10" id="Fig_10"></a>

<span class="caption">Fig. 10.&mdash;Diagram to illustrate a cyclone travelling towards
the east. The two concentric circles represent isobars, that is,
they are lines drawn through points where the barometer
registers the same (low) pressure. Into the area of low pressure
so formed the winds blow strongly in the direction known as
counterclockwise, and are represented by the arrows whose
double barbs signify their strength. It will be noted that in
the rear of the cyclone the winds are northerly. They thus
chill the air here, and by chilling it <i>raise</i> the pressure. The
winds to the front of the cyclone are warm because southerly,
they therefore tend to <i>lower</i> the pressure here by warming the
air, and the result is that the isobars tend to be displaced
towards the east, and at the same time become deformed.
In other words, the cyclone moves to the east.</span>
</div>

<p>We may take British weather, which has
become a proverb on account of its variableness,
as a text for a brief discussion of the
subject.</p>

<p><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></a></p>

<p>The daily variations in our weather, as all
who have read weather reports know, are
chiefly determined by the movements of areas
of low pressure or cyclones, which mostly
come to us from the Atlantic, and continue
eastwards past us, often towards the Baltic.
We have already noted the occurrence of
what we have called a permanent area of
low pressure in the North Atlantic, but
this “permanent area” in point of fact is
due chiefly to the constant passage here of
cyclones, or moving areas of low pressure.</p>

<p>The causes of the eastward displacement
of these depressions are interesting. One
cause is the general eastward movement of
the atmosphere in this region, produced in the
fashion already described. This movement
necessarily raises the pressure to the west of
the depression, owing to the influx of fresh
air, while the onward movement of the air
in front of the depression lowers the pressure
there, and so produces displacement. Again,
the air is sucked into a depression in the
direction opposite to the hands of a clock,
and a moment’s reflection will show that this
means that the winds to the east of the depression
are southerly and those to the west of<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></a>
it northerly. The warm southerly winds in
front tend to lower the pressure by warming
the air, while the cold northerly winds behind
it raise the pressure by cooling the air. This
again produces a displacement of the depression
towards the east (see <a href="#Fig_10">fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>The fact just described has an interesting
practical result. If after a day or night of
storm and rain, the temperature falls, we
know that the depression causing the storm
has passed us, and that we are feeling the
effects of the colder winds in its rear. If the
thermometer suddenly rises again, then a new
depression is approaching, and we are feeling
its warm breath before its winds reach us.
The clearness and chilliness of the air after
a stormy or windy period gives us one of our
commonest meteorological sensations, and
produces a marked psychical effect, reflected
in much of our literature.</p>

<p>One other reason for the eastward motion
of the cyclones with us is that they seem to
prefer damp air, and so tend to follow the
North Sea and pass towards the Baltic, where
they often die away.</p>

<p>In the British area, though the depressions
move faster in winter than in summer, they<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></a>
have only a mean speed of about 16 miles an
hour, while in the United States their mean
speed is 25 miles per hour, and their effects
are often disastrous except when discounted
by the warnings of the Weather Bureau.</p>

<p>In the case of the British Isles cyclones are
most frequent and best marked in winter,
and they are of great importance in producing
our mild and windy winters. In summer
they travel further northwards, and as a rule
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'effect'">affect</ins> our climate less. When, however,
from causes still inadequately known, they
are better marked in summer than usual, we
have a “bad” summer, that is, one which
is wet and relatively windy.</p>

<p>The fact that the English Channel is
one of the favourite tracks of cyclones has
been an important element in protecting
the British Islands from foreign invasion,
while we all know that it is also a factor
in diminishing free intercourse with the
Continent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_11" id="Fig_11"></a>
<img src="images/i011.png" width="400" height="490" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 11.&mdash;Diagram showing the changes in temperature,
pressure and wind due to a cyclone passing to the north of
a point of observation A. The passage of the cyclone figured
occupied a period of six days. It will be noted that as it
approaches A the wind is southerly and light (arrows with
single barbs) and the temperature high. As it passes the winds
become violent (arrows with double barbs), and shift to the
south-west, and the barometer falls rapidly. As it disappears
the pressure rises, the temperature falls, and the wind veers
to the north-west, while remaining violent. The fall of the
wind and its shifting to a south-westerly direction mark the
return to the normal condition of affairs, the influence of the
cyclone being past.</span>
</div>

<p>The second point of importance about our
weather is the periodic occurrence at some
part of our area of anticyclones, or areas of
high pressure, out of which the winds stream
gently in the same direction as the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a><br /><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the clock. These areas of high pressure do
not display the same tendency to move as do
the cyclones, and are most frequently merely
displaced by advancing cyclones. For reasons
into which space does not permit us to go
fully here, anticyclones have a very different
effect in summer and in winter. In winter
they may bring to us the continental cold,
and make our weather abnormally severe,
though often bright and fine. On the other
hand, in summer they bring to us continental
warmth, so that “good” summers are those
in which anticyclonic conditions are most frequent,
while “severe” winters are due to the
same cause. Anticyclones also sometimes induce
a curious form of inversion, in that places
to the north of a given spot may have temporarily
a higher temperature than places
to the south. It is such facts which are
entirely masked by “mean” figures.</p>

<p>We do not as yet understand the causes
which make cyclones sometimes more numerous
or better marked than usual, which cause
them sometimes to cross our area, and at
other times to travel too far north or too far
south to influence our weather. It is possible
that further investigation in the future may<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></a>
unravel this problem; it is practically certain
that a freer use of wireless telegraphy, and
the establishing of meteorological stations in
northern seas, would give weather forecasting
a definiteness and accuracy which it does not
yet possess.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_12" id="Fig_12"></a>

<p>We cannot follow this interesting subject<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"><span class="pagenum">[111]</span></a>
further here, but we have said enough to
illustrate its geographical significance. As a
science or sub-science by itself it will form
the subject of a special volume in this series.
It may be enough to point out that the <i>Daily
Weather Report</i>, published by the Meteorological
Office at a cost of one penny, and
reproduced in some daily newspapers, is a
document well worth the careful study of
those with any interest in geography.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE PRINCIPLES OF PLANT GEOGRAPHY AND
THE CHIEF PLANT FORMATIONS OF
EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA</h3>


<p>We have now taken a general survey of
the earth’s surface, have noted its mountain
heights and its ocean depths, watched the
formation of hills and valleys which is due
to the joint action of atmospheric agents,
running water and ice, and considered briefly
some of the points of interest about climate.
We next pass to that most characteristic
feature of the surface, its clothing of plants.
Except where the surface of the ground
has been artificially sterilised by man, or is
rendered unproductive by ice, by lava, by
a total lack of water, or by the existence of
poisonous salts, it is clothed with vegetation,
and it is the presence of this vegetation
which is its most obvious character.</p>

<p><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"><span class="pagenum">[113]</span></a></p>

<p>Here, however, as in other regions of
thought, the geographical standpoint has
only been reached slowly. Man’s habit of
analysis made him study grasses and trees
for long generations before he got back to the
forest and to the grassland as they occur in
nature. Plants as individuals are the province
of the botanist, but those plant groups
which are the expression of the interaction
of climatic factors, soil, and surface relief, are
the concern of the geographer.</p>

<p>When we take a general survey of the
face of the earth from the point of view of
plant geography, we note three main conditions.
In certain regions, alike in the
tropics and in temperate zones, we find that
plants reach their maximum size, combined
with great differentiation of structure, and
the formation of woody stems which offer
great resistance to varying conditions of
climate and weather. Such highly-organised
plants form forests, which still dominate
over a large part of the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>Man’s nearest allies, the anthropoid apes
and the monkeys, are for the most part forest
animals, and the lowest races of men are still
forest dwellers. Where man is a forest
dweller he seems not to reach his full size,<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></a>
as we see in the case of the pigmies of the
Congo forest, and the negritos of the Philippines,
and he suffers from a chronic insufficiency
of food, which acts as a check both to
his mental and physical development. There
has, therefore, always been war between
evolving man and the giants of the plant
world, a war which has swept the forests
away from many of the more civilised parts
of the globe, and which still continues, though
man’s victory is now so complete that he can
afford to be generous, and give protection to
the remnants of his former foe.</p>

<p>But over parts of the globe the climate,
and especially the amount or distribution
of the rainfall, makes it difficult or impossible
for forests to grow naturally. Here other
types of plants, lower in stature, and evading
rather than facing the problems of winter
cold or summer drought, flourish and form
what we call the grasslands. The grasslands
favour man in several respects. They feed
the animals upon which he depends for food,
for clothing, and for the conveyance of his
person or property, and they offer much less
resistance than the forest to his agricultural
operations. Even the large herbivorous
mammals which in their wild state haunt the<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></a>
forests, usually leave these at night to feed
upon the grasslands, so that it is the grasslands
which have largely fed man at every
stage of civilisation. The atmospheric conditions
within the woodlands also, the deficient
sunlight, the humidity, and so forth,
seem unfavourable to human development.</p>

<p>Where the conditions are especially unfavourable
to plant life, we find that even the
grassland plants are unable to keep up the
struggle, and diminish in number, losing
their power of forming a complete covering
for the soil, and thus the grassland passes into
desert, whether the hot waterless desert of
low latitudes, or the cold frozen desert of
northern ones.</p>

<p>In the most general sense, then, we may
say that these three formations, woodland,
grassland and desert, divide the surface of
the land among them, and between them
there is constant conflict. The grasslands
are for ever attempting to encroach upon the
woodlands, and in this attempt they have
been assisted, sometimes to too great an extent,
by the operations of man. Similarly the
desert is always striving to encroach upon
the grassland, and in this endeavour it has
been sometimes involuntarily aided by man,<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></a>
who has also done much voluntarily to reclaim
the desert land for the grasses.</p>

<p>Let us note next the particular conditions
which favour woodland, grassland and desert
respectively. The distribution of plants over
the surface of the earth at large is determined
by a number of factors, by the amount
of heat, by the amount and distribution of
precipitation, by the nature and strength
of the winds, by the characters of the soil,
and so on. But forests occur under the
equator and also far to the north; we have
cold deserts as well as hot ones; there are
extensive grasslands in the Sudan as well
as in the Canadian Far West. This proves
that the varying amounts of heat may be
neglected in considering the cause of the
distribution of the three great plant formations.</p>

<p>Again, the soil is of minor importance,
for different types of forest and of grassland
occur on different types of soils. We are
thus led to the conclusion that it is the precipitation
and the wind which determine the
distribution. To understand the reason for
this we must consider the needs of different
types of plants in the matter of water.</p>

<p>Plants can only take in the mineral constituents<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></a>
of their food in the form of a solution,
and this solution must be weak, or it
has a poisonous effect. For example, sulphate
of ammonia is a valuable manure, but
if a considerable amount be dissolved in
water and applied to the roots of a growing
plant, death may very likely take place.</p>

<p>It is a necessary consequence of the fact
that plants can only absorb weak solutions
of their food salts, that their roots take in
more water than is actually needed by the
plant. <i>One</i> of the functions of the leaves
is therefore to get rid of surplus water, the
process being called transpiration. Transpiration
takes place faster in a tall plant
like a tree, which grows up into dry layers
of the air, than in a low plant like a grass.
It takes place faster in windy weather than
in calm. Other things being equal it takes
place faster in warm weather than in cold,
and the larger the plant and the more numerous
its leaves the more water is given off,
that is, the more water is returned to the air
from the soil.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that forest trees
require far more water than grassland. It
has been calculated that a beech wood aged
50 to 60 years gives off during the growing<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></a>
season 354 tons of water per acre, which
illustrates the drying effect of the presence
of the wood. Similarly, the effect of tree-planting
in the marshy regions of France and
Italy, where the soil as a consequence has
dried and the marshes disappeared, shows
how great a demand upon ground water trees
make, as compared with grasses and low
growing herbs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, although trees take an
enormous amount of water from the soil,
they can draw their supplies from a large area.
It is the extremities of the fine branches of
the roots which take in the water, and these
pass deep down into the soil, and spread out
over a vast area. In other words, trees avail
themselves of the water in the deeper layers
of the soil, and can tolerate relatively long
periods of drought, if the surface drying of
the soil does not extend to the deeper layers.
In hot summer weather grasslands brown
and wither long before the trees show any
signs of water-famine.</p>

<p>In consequence, we may say that as long
as the total rainfall of a region is sufficient
to ensure a constant supply of moisture
in the subsoil during the growing season,
trees can thrive, even if little or no rain falls<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></a>
during this season. On the other hand, drying
winds are very hurtful to trees, especially
if they occur at a period when the tree is
unable, either because of the coldness of the
subsoil, or because of its dryness, to take in
fresh water to replace that which is lost. The
hurtfulness of late frosts is largely due to the
cold suddenly checking root absorption at a
time when the growing parts, acted upon by
the spring winds, are giving out water freely.</p>

<p>Grasses transpire less freely than trees,
but their root system is much shallower
and less well-developed. They depend upon
the water in the upper layers of soil, and
must have frequent, even if gentle, showers
during their growing season, while they are
quite indifferent to drought and even to cutting
winds during their resting period.</p>

<p>A little reflection will show that it results
from these facts that woodland, grassland
and desert do not form a continuous series.
It may quite well be that woodland passes
through scrub into desert without the intervention
of grassland. Right across Europe
there is (or was) a broad belt of forest. Southward
towards the Mediterranean this thins
out into a characteristic form of scrub, called<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"><span class="pagenum">[120]</span></a>
maquis, whose characters we shall describe
later, and this scrub passes in all directions
into desert land. Here no belt of grassland
intervenes, for the rainless Mediterranean
summer makes the growth of grass virtually
impossible, except where special conditions,
<i>e. g.</i> hills, introduce modifications. Contrasted
with this we have the conditions in
North America where, <i>e. g.</i> in Canada, the
western coast is densely forest-clad, as is also
the eastern region. In journeying eastward
after crossing the Rocky Mountains the forest
dies away into grassland, and the same
thing happens, though more slowly, in a westward
journey. The reason is that in this
case there is a steady diminution of precipitation
on passing to the interior, but what
precipitation remains is, as we have seen,
largely, though not wholly, summer rain, and
is, therefore, sufficient to determine the
growth of grass, though not of trees.</p>

<p>Again, in North Africa the forests of the
Atlas Mountains pass directly, without intervening
grassland, into the Sahara desert,
but to the south of the desert the grassy and
park-like Sudan separates the desert from
the luxuriant tropical forest. In the latter<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></a>
case, however, it is possible that man’s influence
has counted for something.</p>

<p>On mountains, in whatever latitude, the
conditions are much more uniform, partly
because it is wind, assisted by temperature
variations, which is the dominating factor.
Moisture is usually abundant, but high up
what is called physiological drought occurs;
that is, the temperature is too low for the
plants to be able to absorb the abundant
water.</p>

<p>In ascending any mountain, the following
are the chief changes which occur. The
lower slopes will probably be cultivated.
As we ascend the precipitation increases, and
forests appear. First we have probably a
belt of deciduous trees, passing above into
the more resistant conifers. This belt usually
ascends higher on the south than on the
north side, and higher on mountains which
occur in a group than on isolated peaks. As
the wind is more and more felt, and increases
the dangerous transpiration of winter the
trees become more and more dwarfed to
escape its force. There may be a belt of
prostrate mountain pines above, marking the
tree limit; in any case the trees are gradually
replaced by dwarfed shrubs. Then comes<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></a>
the zone of Alpine plants, the grasses making
a complete sward, but being accompanied
by many other plants. Gradually, as the
soil becomes scantier, and the surface more
rocky and exposed, the continuous sward
disappears, and the conditions of a cold desert
appear. A few scattered plants occur, ceasing
near the snow-line, the highest being
usually plants of simple structure like mosses
and lichens.</p>

<p>As we have already indicated, in the case
of the mountains of Europe there are often
glacial shelves at considerable elevations,
whose covering of fine débris determines
the growth of peculiarly fine grass. The
economic value of this grassland has in many
cases in the Alps induced man to destroy
the forest in order to increase pasture land.
The result has often been disastrous, for
once the trees are cut down the forest soil is
rapidly destroyed by weathering, especially on
slopes, the courses of streams are altered by
the more rapid run-off, and widespread flooding
and destruction of pastures have sometimes
resulted. In North America, similarly,
man’s attempt to increase pasture land or
arable land at the expense of woodland has
often led to disastrous consequences.</p>

<p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></a></p>

<p>We have already spoken of the special
features of the Mediterranean climate, and
indicated that its peculiarities are reflected
in its vegetation; we must now consider this
vegetation in a little more detail. The fact
that the region is chiefly visited by the
inhabitants of more northern climates in
spring gives rise to a somewhat erroneous
impression in regard to the plants. In spring
the Mediterranean vegetation is at its best.
The mild winters permit the plants which
further north die down or cease to grow, to
go on blooming. The rains so moisten the
soil that the first warm days cause very rapid
growth in those plants which finish their
activities before the hot, dry summer begins.
They must flower and seed in spring, and
die down till the rains of autumn awaken
them again.</p>

<p>In our own country we have a few plants
which hurry through their activities in this
way. The lesser celandine, the wood anemone
and a few others strive to flower and fruit
before the forest trees are thickly clad with
leaves. The snowdrop, even the wild hyacinth,
though it is much later, similarly
limit their active life to a short period in
spring. This phenomenon, only suggested<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></a>
in our climate, is very marked in the Mediterranean
area.</p>

<p>That region is especially characterised by
its richness in bulbous and tuberous plants.
These, as all who have grown hyacinths or
narcissuses know, demand relatively large
amounts of water during their short growing
period. In spring, therefore, the shores of
the Mediterranean are bright with many
kinds of anemones, with narcissus, asphodel,
bell hyacinth, Allium, tulips, and so on, all
awakened by the spring warmth and the
spring rains. Accompanying them are many
bright-coloured annuals, also in a hurry to
race through their life-history before the
terrible drought of summer. Now also the
grass grows, and the autumn-sown corn becomes
tall. As the weather grows hotter and
drier, the plants with bulbous and tuberous
roots die down to the ground, the annuals die
altogether, leaving their seeds to wait till the
autumn rains before they sprout. The grasses
turn brown, and the peculiar parched appearance
of the Mediterranean summer
spreads over the land.</p>

<p>To a northern visitor at this season it is not
luxuriance but desolation which is the prevailing
note. Except on the hill slopes<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"><span class="pagenum">[125]</span></a>
there are no masses of broad-leafed foliage
trees&mdash;there is not the deep bright green
characteristic of the summer woods further
north. The trees do not reach a great size;
the leaves are usually small, and the fact that
they strive to avoid the sun by arranging
themselves with the edge upwards instead of
the flat surface, makes them appear smaller
than they are. They are often needle-shaped,
sometimes shining and coated with resin,
sometimes silvery owing to a coating of hairs
on the under surface. Many plants have
spines or thorns, and succulent plants like
agave, aloe and prickly pear are common.
The absence of a complete covering of
vegetation causes the surface soil to dry
completely, and so form clouds of dust which
adds to the generally desolate appearance.
Indeed, the brown powdery appearance of
the soil is one of the points which especially
strikes the stranger, accustomed to the darker,
moister soil of the north, always covered
with vegetation, except where man has
interfered.</p>

<p>Here and there, however, are indications
that even this parched brown earth holds
wealth for man. The vines, if dusty and far
less luxuriant than one expects, are loaded<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></a>
with ripening fruit. The gorgeous scarlet
flowers of the double pomegranate gleam amid
the dark foliage; the gnarled and twisted
olives show on close inspection masses of
small green fruits; the oleander bushes are
covered with pink flowers; there are great
round balls on the orange and lemon trees,
and many other fruit trees are loaded with
produce.</p>

<p>Let us sum up first what man gains from the
plants of the Mediterranean, and then look
at some points in regard to the wild plants.
In the first place, we see that man takes advantage
of the rapid growth of annuals in the
early part of the year. The annuals most
useful to him, here as elsewhere, are, of course,
the cereals, especially wheat, which, if sown
in autumn, is nourished by the winter rains,
and grows rapidly with the warmth of spring
to ripen in May, June or July, according to
the locality.</p>

<p>In the second place, certain trees or shrubs,
by reason of their resistance to drought, and
their elaborate root system, which enables
them to gather water from the deeper layers
of the soil, will produce succulent fruits
without needing artificial supplies of water.
The most important of these, throughout the<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></a>
whole Mediterranean area, are the vine and
the olive. The olive supplies the oil which
is all the more necessary in that the absence
of grass makes pastoral industries, and therefore
the production of cheese and butter
difficult or impossible except in the high
grounds, while the vine supplies the wine
which with bread and oil form the essential
parts of the diet of Mediterranean man.</p>

<p>The olive tree, which is indigenous, may be
regarded as one of the most characteristic
trees of the area, and it is interesting to note
that the novice not infrequently confuses
it with another tree, almost as characteristic
the evergreen or holm oak. The two are not
nearly related, the olive belonging to the
same family as the lilac and privet, while the
evergreen oak is a true oak. Both trees,
however, show similar adaptations to summer
drought, and their resemblance to one another
is a good example of convergence due
to a similar environment. Both have small
evergreen leaves; small that they may not
lose too much water in summer, evergreen
that they may assimilate even during the
winter. Both have their leaves silvery beneath,
which again prevents loss of water;
both have gnarled trunks, branching low<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></a>
down, in order that the leaves may avoid the
dry upper layers of the air. Adaptations of
this kind are present to a greater or less degree
in all the trees which are tolerant of
Mediterranean conditions, and many of these
trees yield useful fruits.</p>

<p>In addition to the cultivated plants mentioned,
a great number of others are grown
within the area, as we shall see later, but the
point of interest is that the plants which have
been of importance in the history of the region
have been either annuals which ripened early,
or fruit-bearing trees with special adaptations
to resist drought.</p>

<p>Apart from the annuals and the bulbous
and tuberous plants already described, the
wild plants are chiefly shrubs or stunted trees
with similar drought-resisting characters.
During the long ages he has inhabited the
Mediterranean, man has doubtless contributed
largely to the destruction of the forests
which are now, as we have seen, represented
by the stunted scrub or maquis. But on
climatic grounds we cannot suppose that the
Mediterranean forests had ever the luxuriance
of those further north, or of the tropical
forests of the south.</p>

<p>Where there is sufficient rain chestnut<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"><span class="pagenum">[129]</span></a>
woods occur, but this is only on the hill slopes.
Above the chestnut, beech may occur, as in
Sicily. The maritime pine and the Corsican
pine form open woods in the damper places,
and the picturesque stone pine, with its
rounded head, is very characteristic. We
have already mentioned the evergreen or
holm oak as common, and the cork oak occurs
abundantly in some places. These trees, with
the cypress, must have formed the primitive
forests, and they still constitute the most
important forest trees of the area. The occurrence
of a native palm (<i>Chamærops</i>) is interesting
as suggesting the warmth of the climate,
and even on the European shores the
date palm is extensively planted, though its
true home is the margin of the African and
Arabian deserts.</p>

<p>Of the characteristic shrubs the most
striking are perhaps the many species of Cistus,
with large almost rose-like flowers, and
leaves which attempt to adapt themselves to
the climate by many different devices. Sometimes
they are stiff and leathery, sometimes
resinous, sometimes hairy. Many plants in
the area have a coating of resin on their leaves.
This, no doubt, preserves them against loss
of water, but also probably protects against<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></a>
grazing animals. Goats thrive in the
Mediterranean partly because of the catholicity
of their taste in vegetation, and in consequence
the plants have had to protect themselves
against their appetite as well as
against drought. Only those with some disagreeable
quality, hairs, spines, resin, strong
flavour, etc., could hope to protect themselves
in the dry season, when grass is virtually
absent. It is in consequence common to
find aromatic or strongly-flavoured plants
with glandular leaves; lavender, rosemary,
myrtle, etc., are examples.</p>

<p>Other shrubby plants associated with the
Mediterranean are oleander, the noble laurel,
the tree heath, arbutus, many kinds of broom,
and generally evergreen shrubs specially
adapted to resist drought.</p>

<p>Let us turn from this picture to the appearance
presented by Central and Northern
Europe. As we have seen, the forest which
once covered most of the area, except the
steppe region of southern Russia, has largely
disappeared, but enough remains to enable
us to reconstruct the picture of the original
forest.</p>

<p>As contrasted with the (chiefly) evergreen
woodland of the Mediterranean, the forests<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></a>
of the low grounds are here deciduous. In
summer clothed in magnificent foliage, well
adapted to give off enormous quantities of
water, in winter the trees stand tall and bare,
exposing nothing but their branches to the
winter blasts. While the buds of Mediterranean
plants have no special means of protection,
the typical forest trees of Central
Europe have their buds carefully sheathed
in scales, clothed in hairs, or coated with
resin, to keep out alike the cold and the damp
of the northern winter. While the leaves of
Mediterranean plants are usually small, often
coated with hairs beneath, often resinous,
and so on, the forest trees further north have
large leaves of delicate texture, with no
special protection against drought.</p>

<p>Again, while the luxuriant forest of the
tropics includes many different species of
trees, the deciduous forests of cool temperate
regions contain few species, and are often
pure woods, that is, consist of one dominant
species, forming beech woods or oak woods,
and so on. The dense shade of the beech
makes undergrowth difficult or impossible,
but the other woods have a complicated
undergrowth of many different kinds of
plants, especially pronounced in spring before<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></a>
the leaves appear on the trees. But this undergrowth
never reaches the luxuriance that
it does in the tropical forest, and creepers and
climbing plants are few.</p>

<p>As we ascend from the low ground to the
higher, or as we travel northwards to high
latitudes, the broad-leafed deciduous forests
are replaced by coniferous ones. European
conifers, with the exception of the larch,
are evergreen, and all are more tolerant of
cold and wind than deciduous trees. Pines,
spruce, fir, larch, and silver fir are the most
important kinds. Both at high altitudes
and in high latitudes these conifers are often
accompanied by birch, which is not a cone-bearing
tree, but is very tolerant of cold and
wind.</p>

<p>To the north there comes sooner or later
a limit beyond which the cold and winds
make further tree growth impossible. Here
we come to a tundra region, where the place of
trees is taken by low-growing shrubs, with
small leaves and other adaptations to ensure
against excessive loss of water. It is, as it
were, the reappearance of the Mediterranean
type, but here the cause is, not the absence of
water, but the fact that the cold makes it
impossible for the roots to absorb it. A condition<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></a>
of physiological drought results, and
only plants well adapted to prevent undue
loss of water can resist such conditions of
life.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar type of vegetation
occurs over vast areas in the more northern
parts of Europe, forming the moors and
heaths of much of Scotland, of parts of England
and Ireland, of parts of Germany, and so
on. Here the presence of peat produces conditions
very unfavourable to plant life, except
to certain shrubby plants such as heather and
other plants of the heather family, juniper,
bog myrtle, and so on, and some grasses
and sedges, etc., all of which have special
adaptations to life in a peaty soil. Over the
large areas, therefore, covered by these heaths,
trees are absent, or few, and this stunted
shrubby vegetation takes their place.</p>

<p>Large areas of natural grassland, except
for the tracts of pasture land already described
in the mountain regions, are infrequent
in Europe. They occur in Southern
Russia and in the Hungarian plain, and form
part of that great series of steppes and plains
which stretches into Asia, and passes into a
region of deserts.</p>

<p>The conditions favourable to the growth of<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></a>
grass here, instead of trees, seem to be purely
climatic. Very important is the prevalence
of strong cold winds during winter, which is a
period of drought. The scanty rains come
in early summer, which suits grasses admirably,
while the total precipitation is too slight
for trees. The summers are hot, and the
rains cease early and give place to a period
of drought, very injurious to trees, while it
injures the grasses little, owing to the fact
that they have had time to make their
growth.</p>

<p>The abundant natural growth of grass
makes these steppe regions well suited to the
pastoral industries, which tend, as civilisation
progresses, to give place to agriculture.</p>

<p>To sum up, we have seen that looking at
Europe as a whole three great plant formations
are represented. We have, first, the
cool temperate forest, which once extended
over the greater part of the continent, wherever
the conditions were suitable. This has
now largely given place to arable land. Next,
we find round the Mediterranean sea, and in
those great peninsulas and islands which are
bathed by it, a zone of modified woodland
passing into scrub, remarkable for the rapid
growth of annuals in the early part of the year,<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"><span class="pagenum">[135]</span></a>
and for the abundance of trees bearing useful
fruits. Finally, linking Europe to temperate
Asia, we have belts of steppe land, characterised
by a luxuriant growth of grass in the
early summer, and fitted by nature for
pastoral industries, which do not thrive near
the Mediterranean. Another way of putting
the same facts would be to say that Europe
proper is a region of temperate forest, linked
to Africa by scrub land passing into desert,
and to Asia by steppe land passing into
desert.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The flora of North America, owing to the
size of the continent, offers more resemblance
to that of Asia than to Europe.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind what has been already
said about the structure of North America&mdash;with
its western mountain range and eastern
uplands enclosing between them a region
of moderate relief&mdash;and also what has been
said in regard to its climates and to the influence
of climate upon vegetation, it is
relatively easy to deduce the main points
in regard to the flora.</p>

<p>To the far north there is a treeless tundra
region, quite comparable to that which
occurs over vast areas in North Asia, and on<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></a>
a reduced scale in the northern part of the
continent of Europe. Next we have a wide
band of predominantly coniferous forest,
which, although its species are different, yet
in broad outline is entirely homologous with
the coniferous forest found in northern Asia,
south of the tundra region. In Canada this
forest consists of spruces and larches, the
species being peculiar to the continent.
Mingled with the conifers are smaller numbers
of the hardier deciduous trees, such as
birches, poplars, and willows.</p>

<p>What we have already said as to the
climatic differences between the eastern and
western sides of continents will at once suggest
that this band of forest is not likely to
run directly across the continent from east
to west. In point of fact it stretches from
Labrador in a north-westerly direction to
Alaska, leaving almost the whole of the
western <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sea-board'">seaboard</ins> to be occupied by another
type. This type is the extraordinarily luxuriant
and beautiful western forest, consisting
for the most part of conifers. It is largely
these conifers which have enriched European
parks and gardens within recent years, and
although it is perhaps the great <i>Sequoia</i>
(<i>Wellingtonia</i>) <i>gigantea</i> which has most impressed<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"><span class="pagenum">[137]</span></a>
popular imagination, it must be
remembered that size and luxuriance are
characteristic of many species. This western
forest stretches down the western seaboard to
the State of California, and, indeed, persists
until increasing aridity makes forest growth
impossible. Its great luxuriance, compared
with the scantier forests of the Mediterranean
region in Europe, is partly to be ascribed
to a greater rainfall, and doubtless partly
to man’s interference, for the original forests
of the Mediterranean must have been largely
destroyed, as the western American forests
are in process of being. One must remember
also that the proximity of mountain ranges
to the seaboard in western North America
gives a heavy rainfall, and suitable places
for forest growth. The fact that the trees are
predominantly coniferous gives them great
resistance to the summer drought. In front
of the mountain ranges the coastal plain is
occupied by an evergreen scrub vegetation
comparable to that of the lowlands of the
Mediterranean basin.</p>

<p>In British Columbia, where the Cascade
Range lies at no great distance from the
Rocky Mountains, the western coniferous
forest practically clothes the whole area from<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></a>
the coast to the main range, but further south,
where the Cascade Range and its continuation
the Sierra Nevada are widely separated
from the main range, a dry and semi-desert
region occurs, between the two, which bears
a desert type of vegetation, including especially
a plant related to our wormwood, called
sagebrush, with cactuses in the warmer parts.
Another area which is too arid to carry trees,
except where local conditions raise the rainfall,
extends from Texas northwards to about
the latitude of Edmonton or Battleford,
and lies in the “rain shadow” of the Rocky
Mountains. This is the region of the Great
Plains, mostly too arid to carry anything
but herds of cattle, and mostly forming
natural pasture, being thus analogous to the
steppes of Asia.</p>

<p>Eastward the rainfall increases, and we pass
from the area of unreclaimed pasture to the
prairies, now largely laid down to wheat and
other food plants. Southward the Great
Plains pass into the deserts of Mexico, but
northwards they are separated from the
northern coniferous forest by a belt of aspen,
and it is in this region that the Canadians
are steadily pushing the cultivation of wheat<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"><span class="pagenum">[139]</span></a>
into the plains, wherever the local rainfall
makes this possible.</p>

<p>So far we have left south-eastern Canada
and the whole of the eastern and south-eastern
States out of consideration. Speaking very
broadly, we may say that all this area is
clothed by a forest of mixed coniferous and
broad-leaved trees which is comparable to
the forest which covers the greater part
of temperate Europe. But it is not to be
expected that a forest which extends from
the northern shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence
to the extremity of the peninsula of
Florida, that is, through about 25 degrees of
latitude, should be uniform throughout. In
point of fact, botanists distinguish three
separate zones. In south-eastern Canada
and the New England states the Weymouth
pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>) predominates, being
accompanied by limes, ashes, maples, oaks,
elms, chestnuts, and so forth. Further
south, and especially further west, extending
to the Mississippi plains, there is a deciduous
forest extraordinarily rich in species. Practically
all our common genera of forest trees
are represented, sometimes by very fine
species, but in addition there are many
genera with no European representatives.<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></a>
Very striking is the abundance of magnolias
(whence the name of magnolia forest sometimes
given to this type), and species of the
laurel family, as well as of liquidambar.
The magnolias and liquidambar are especially
interesting, because they once occurred in
Europe, their disappearance there being
probably caused by the glacial period as
explained on <a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>.</p>

<p>We have emphasised above (<a href="#Page_137">p. 137</a>) the
luxuriance of the forests of the west coast of
the States, but it should be noticed that
luxuriant as its conifers are, there is a remarkable
poverty in broad-leaved forms, as compared
with these eastern forests, and this
even in the warmer parts of the west coast.
The reason is probably the same as in the
Mediterranean region in Europe. The existence
of a belt of desert to the south of the
present “Mediterranean” region of western
America made it difficult for the trees to
migrate southwards at the onset of cold conditions
in the glacial period, and thus many
forms, which are known to have existed in
California in Tertiary times, have now completely
disappeared from the region, while
they persist in the eastern forests to this
day.</p>

<p><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"><span class="pagenum">[141]</span></a></p>

<p>The third type of forest which occurs in the
eastern half of North America is the “rain
forest” of Florida and parts of the adjacent
states. Here the rainfall is abundant all the
year round, with a summer maximum, and
the temperature is high. There is thus no
need to economise water, and where the soil
permits there is a luxuriant type of forest,
which recalls that of the tropics, although it
is poorer. Where soil conditions are unfavourable
we have pine woods, conifers
throughout the eastern United States always
taking advantage of conditions relatively
unfavourable to the broad-leafed trees.</p>

<p>Thus if we follow the eastern seaboard
of the United States from Labrador to Florida
we pass through the following floral regions:&mdash;(1)
Coniferous forest, with relatively few
species, (2) mixed coniferous and deciduous
forest with chiefly the harder types of
deciduous trees, (3) predominantly deciduous
forest with many of the larger-leafed and
more delicate forms, and finally (4) forest of
the sub-tropical rainy type, intermixed with
coniferous woods on the barren sandy soil
and in the swamps.</p>

<p>The western coast shows more uniformity,
the western type of coniferous forest stretching<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></a>
from Alaska to California, though it is
richer, and more luxuriant in the warmer
regions when moisture is still obtainable.
As the moisture diminishes the forest dies
away and desert or semi-desert conditions
supervene.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANIMAL LIFE</h3>


<p>In the last chapter we looked at a few of
the interesting generalisations which have
emerged of late years from the study of plant
distribution. An enormous amount of detailed
investigation had been done before
these generalisations were arrived at, and
though still much remains to be done, yet
the broad lines of a science of plant distribution
may now be said to be established. The
scientific study of animal distribution has not
yet reached a corresponding stage of advancement,
partly no doubt because the dependence
of the more highly organised and active
animal upon the physical conditions is less
close than that of the stationary plant, so
that the subject is more difficult. Facts are
accumulating on all sides, but the subject is
still rather at the level of collecting information<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></a>
than at that of laying down broad
generalisations. There are, however, indications
of progress in many directions, and an
attempt will be made here to suggest some of
the lines along which research is especially
busy at the present time.</p>

<p>In speaking of plants we confined our
attention exclusively to land plants, for the
reason that aquatic plants are usually small in
size, relatively simple in structure, of somewhat
limited vertical distribution, owing to
their dependence upon light, and of little
direct importance to man. In considering
animals, on the other hand, we cannot exclude
the aquatic forms, which are often of great
human importance. In many regions man
depends largely, sometimes even exclusively,
on the animals of the sea for his food. We
shall, then, begin with some account of
aquatic animals, considering the subject, as
before, especially from the point of view of the
inhabitants of Europe and North America.</p>

<p>Beginning with the sea we find that the
scientific study of marine animals received an
enormous impetus from the work of the
<i>Challenger</i> expedition. The results of that
expedition appeared in many large volumes,
which form a conspicuous feature in any<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></a>
complete scientific library and contain a mass
of useful material. The <i>Challenger</i> expedition
was followed by many others, European and
American, and the result is that we now know
a great deal about marine animals and their
distribution. Further, the Fishery Boards
of various Governments carry on continuous
observations on the conditions of life in
the seas near their coasts, which have
added and are adding enormously to our
knowledge.</p>

<p>We cannot here consider in detail the
various facts brought to light by these
means. Only a few general points can be
touched upon. One interesting generalisation
is that the life of the ocean can be divided
into three groups: the life of the littoral or
shore zone, the life of the open ocean (pelagic
fauna), and the life of the great ocean depths
(abyssal fauna). The last, though of great
zoological interest, is so remote from human
life that we need not consider it. The pelagic
forms include both the small delicate organisms
which float passively with the ocean
currents, and also powerful swimmers like
many fish, and aquatic mammals such as
whales and seals. The littoral forms live in
the region which is within the reach of land<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></a>
influences, that is, from low-tide mark to the
edge of the Continental Shelf (cf. <a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>).
Among forms directly important to man they
include many fish; crustaceans such as crabs
and lobsters; shell-fish such as oysters, mussels,
clams, etc.; less important forms such
as sea-urchins, which are extensively eaten in
the Mediterranean; sponges, an important
article of commerce; the various corals, especially
the precious coral, and so on.</p>

<p>Of the useful marine animals, those which
are most readily captured are the littoral
forms, many of which, on shores where the
tides are well marked, are exposed, or at
least brought within easy reach, by the daily
ebb and flow of the tide, and can be obtained
with the minimum of apparatus. The extensive
shell-mounds found on many shores, <i>e. g.</i>
on those of Denmark, show at how early a
date man availed himself of the abundant
food supply to be obtained on the shore rocks.
All edible animals found in the sea are “fish”
to maritime populations, but fish in the
restricted sense are usually more active, and
require more skill for their capture than the
less intelligent molluscs or crustaceans, and
were probably not used at so early a date.
They are by no means equally distributed in<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></a>
all seas, and their distribution shows many
points of interest.</p>

<p>We must notice, in the first instance, that
the waste of the land is of great importance
in feeding marine forms, whether directly or
indirectly. Marine animals, therefore, occur
most abundantly over the Continental Shelf,
where they are within reach of the food
brought down by the rivers from the land.
Again, many fish, or the organisms upon
which fish feed, depend largely upon those
minute plants called diatoms which float in
the upper layers of the waters of the ocean.
These are especially abundant in the colder
seas, which doubtless helps to explain the
abundance of fish in high latitudes. These
diatoms, like many other small organisms in
the sea, are swept about by the ocean currents,
whose course greatly influences the
movements of fish.</p>

<p>We saw in the case of forests that hot
climates conduce to a great variety of species,
while in colder climates the species are few,
but the number of individuals very great.
Something of the same sort seems to occur
with fishes. In warm seas the number of
species is very great, while in colder seas
there are fewer species, but those which do<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></a>
occur are sometimes found in vast numbers.
Fortunately for man these prolific northern
species are often edible, whereas in warm
seas poisonous or inedible forms are common.
The valuable cod family is found chiefly in
high latitudes.</p>

<p>The consequence of the facts just described
is that valuable fisheries tend to occur in cool
or cold climates rather than hot ones, and
because of the dependence of so many forms
on the Continental Shelf, they occur in the
northern or land hemisphere rather than in
the southern or oceanic one.</p>

<p>The most valuable fisheries in the world
seem to be those off Newfoundland, where
the broad Continental Shelf, forming the so-called
“banks,” feeds myriads of cod. The
mingling of the waters brought by the cold
Labrador currents with those brought by the
warm Gulf Stream perhaps influences this
marvellous abundance of fish, as does also the
waste brought by the icebergs.</p>

<p>Next to the banks of Newfoundland the
most valuable fishing ground is the shallow
North Sea, which, as we have seen, lies on the
surface of the Continental Shelf. Fish are
much more abundant here than on the narrower
shelf on the western coast of Britain,<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></a>
and the wealth of the North Sea has been an
important factor in the development of the
countries bordering it.</p>

<p>The warm, salt, relatively deep, and tide-less
Mediterranean is not nearly so rich in
food fishes as the more northerly seas, a fact
reflected in the large importation of dried
fish alike from Newfoundland and from the
region of the North Sea. But this is an
economic and not a zoological statement, for
the Mediterranean is in reality richer in fish
species than the North Sea, in this respect, as
in some others, approaching tropical regions.
Among the economically important fish are
the tunny, a very large form allied to the
mackerel, which is dried, and sardines and
anchovies, which are preserved in oil. Otherwise
the fish are eaten fresh, and do not enter
into general trade.</p>

<p>Fresh-water fish are abundant all over
Europe, but with some exceptions they are
not greatly prized in those countries where
the better-flavoured marine fish can be obtained.
Elsewhere, as in Russia, Germany,
and parts of France, they become important.</p>

<p>Much more valuable than fresh-water fish
in the strict sense are the various kinds of
salmon, which come up the rivers to breed,<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></a>
but spend much time also in salt water. In
the rivers of Scotland and Scandinavia salmon
are still very important, but the fisheries in
both cases are insignificant when compared
with those of western North America. Salmon
are inhabitants of temperate waters, and
in North America do not extend further south
than the rivers flowing into the north of the
Gulf of California. Off the coast of Alaska
and British Columbia, especially the former,
they are enormously abundant, and being
caught in quantities which far exceed the
local demand are largely canned for export.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in regard to
fresh-water fish, as with marine forms, the
northern part of the world is especially rich
in edible species, as compared alike with the
southern hemisphere and with the tropics.
The salmon family is confined to the northern
hemisphere, and the carp family, though not
peculiar, is largely represented in the north.
To it belong the whitefish, which form important
food fish in many parts of America.
Sturgeon, which are important in Russia,
occur in the great rivers of eastern Europe,
and in parts of Asia, and also on the eastern
coast of North America, and off California.</p>

<p>Turning next to the distribution of land<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"><span class="pagenum">[151]</span></a>
animals within the European area, the first
point is to note that for the globe at large
zoologists employ zoogeographical divisions
based chiefly upon the distribution of the
land <i>mammals</i>. The reasons for this are
manifold.</p>

<p>In the first place, mammals are of relatively
recent origin, and in taking account of their
spread over the globe, we may assume that
in broad outline the continents, or at least the
deep oceans, were much the same when the
existing mammals were evolved as at present.
This naturally simplifies the problem, for if
we divided the globe into regions on the basis
of the distribution of reptiles, for example,
we should find it necessary to take account of
many differences between the world in which
the first reptiles arose and the world as it is at
present.</p>

<p>Again, the chances of land mammals passing
from one region to another, except by the
crossing of land surfaces, are small. Thus the
occurrence of similar land mammals in two
regions now widely separated is almost certain
proof of a former land connection between the
two regions. The difficulty which most land
mammals find in crossing mountain chains, or
deserts, or considerable extents of water,<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"><span class="pagenum">[152]</span></a>
makes it easy to define zoogeographical regions
separated from one another by the existence
of such “barriers to distribution” as they are
called. Finally, mammals are highly organised
animals of relatively large size, and their
distribution is more easily studied than that
of insects, for instance.</p>

<p>Without going into the zoogeographical
regions in detail, we may note that there is,
as already stated, considerable resemblance
between the mammals of Europe, Asia, Africa
and North America, that is, of the land
hemisphere, while South America, which was
for long isolated from North America, has a
peculiar and relatively primitive fauna, and
Australia, whose isolation has lasted longer,
has an even more peculiar and a much more
primitive fauna.</p>

<p>When we look at the fauna of the great land
mass formed by the continents of Europe,
Asia, Africa and North America, sometimes
called by zoogeographers the <i>Arctogæic</i> realm,
we find that North America differs from the
eastern land mass as regards its land mammals
in several respects. Though long separated
from South America it has been connected
long enough for some of the southern
forms to find their way northwards, so that we<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></a>
find skunks, raccoons, and other mammals
strikingly different from analogous forms
found in the Old World. Again, it is relatively
so long since there was any free communication
between the eastern and western
hemispheres that the two faunas have had
time to diverge without destroying the fundamental
resemblance.</p>

<p>Beginning with the fauna of the Old World,
we find that no effective barrier of any sort
separates the animals of Europe, even of
western Europe, from the animals of temperate
Asia, even of eastern Asia. Right across
from the British Isles to Japan, through about
a hundred and fifty degrees of longitude, there
is great general similarity in the land animals.
To the south, on the other hand, the Atlas
mountains and the African desert cut off the
greater part of the continent of Africa, and
eastwards the transverse mountain chains, no
less than the difference of climate and the
cold, barren nature of the uplands of central
Asia, cut off the rich fauna of the peninsula
of India with Further India, etc., from the
habitable regions of temperate Asia, with
their scantier fauna.</p>

<p>We are thus left with the conception of a
very large and tolerably uniform zoological<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></a>
region, stretching right across Europe and
temperate and northern Asia. This is the
Palæarctic region of zoogeographers.</p>

<p>The European section of it is somewhat
impoverished as compared with the Asiatic
section, partly perhaps because of the effects
of the ice, and certainly also because for long
ages Europe has been densely populated, and
the larger wild animals have thus been exterminated.
Asia, with its northern forests and
its more southerly steppes, has always been
a great reservoir of life, which has periodically
overflowed into Europe. Some of these overflowing
animals, like the black and the brown
rats, succeeded in establishing themselves
very firmly; others, like the saiga antelope,
died out rapidly except in the extreme east of
the European area.</p>

<p>It is possible that further investigation will
show that not the mammals only, but land
animals in general can be grouped according
to their habitat like plants, but so far the
attempts made in this direction have been
tentative only. Generally, we may say that
the mammals of Central Europe are of the
woodland type, but no detailed classification
into steppe and woodland animals exists. It
may be useful, therefore, to indicate the chief<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></a>
kinds of mammals found in the European
area, grouped according to affinity, in the
absence of a geographical classification.</p>

<p>Mammals, apart from the egg-laying monotremes,
and the marsupials of Australia, are
divided into nine orders, and of these, one,
that including the anteaters, etc., of South
America, Africa and India, is entirely unrepresented
in Europe. Another, the Cetaceans,
or whales, has no land representatives;
and the same is true of the aberrant sea-cows,
though their ancestors lived on land and
occurred in Egypt.</p>

<p>Excluding these orders we are left with
six which have European representatives.
These are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Primates, or monkeys and apes.</p>

<p>Insectivores, or insect-eating mammals, such
as moles, shrews and hedgehogs.</p>

<p>Chiroptera, or bats.</p>

<p>Ungulates, or hoofed animals, including
horses, cattle, sheep, deer, pigs, etc.</p>

<p>Carnivores, or flesh-eaters, including lions,
cats, foxes, dogs, etc.</p>

<p>Rodents, or gnawing animals, among which
are rats, mice, squirrels, etc.</p>

<p>The <i>Primates</i> are represented by one form
only, the Barbary ape, found in Gibraltar.<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></a>
<i>Bats</i> are numerous, but are of less geographical
interest than land forms. The remaining
four orders are all important. The <i>Ungulates</i>
include the largest land mammals, and their
size and conspicuous nature have led to the
gradual replacement of the wild forms by
domesticated ones. Only a very few, such as
deer, wild goats (ibex), the wild boar, the wild
sheep (moufflon) of Corsica, manage to survive,
and that mostly by aid of special protection.
The presence of the large wild forms
is incompatible with almost any form of
agriculture as is often proved disastrously in
Africa, hence man’s ruthless warfare upon
them.</p>

<p>But if man has destroyed the large ungulates
he has found himself unable even to
reduce the numbers of the <i>Rodents</i>, who gain
in many ways by civilisation. The destruction
of their rivals, the grass-eating ungulates,
increases their natural food-supply. In
South America, where there were very few
ungulates till the white man brought his
flocks and herds, the rodents were very
numerous and reached a great size. Again,
the operations of agriculture give the rodents
enormous artificial sources of food-supply,
and the number of man’s domesticated or<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></a>
semi-domesticated animals makes him wage
a bitter war against the small carnivores, the
natural enemies of the rodents. Protected
from their enemies, abundantly fed by man’s
providence, it is no wonder that these small
animals have multiplied greatly.</p>

<p>Their multiplication has been assisted by
the fact that they inherit from their early
days, when the struggle was keen, an enormous
fertility. Many of the rodents are
steppe animals, and share with steppe organisms
in general the power of periodic multiplication
in enormous numbers.</p>

<p>The steppe is a region where the rainfall is
normally just enough to ensure a free growth
of grass at certain seasons. Variations in
rainfall, which perhaps occur in great cycles,
may at one time produce a luxuriance of
growth which increases the food-supply all
round, and at another give rise to semi-desert
conditions with a resulting enormous
death-rate. The steppe organisms, then,
must be very fertile because of the risks of
their environment, and the Asiatic overflow
is possibly determined by successions of
years of abundant rainfall, which increase
the number of individuals, followed by a
series of years of scanty rain, which make it<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></a>
necessary for the overflow of population to
migrate.</p>

<p>Among examples of European rodents we
may mention the very destructive rats, mice
and voles, which practically feed everywhere
at man’s expense; and the hamster, an
Asiatic form which reaches as far west as the
Rhine, and stores large quantities of corn and
other food in an elaborately made burrow.
The hamster has the rodent power of rapid
multiplication, and is often terribly destructive
to cultivated crops. Rabbits are similarly
very destructive where special precautions
are not taken. Even the porcupine of
southern Europe is capable of doing considerable
damage. Less serious enemies of man
are such forms as the following:&mdash;lemmings;
marmots, of which there are two forms, an
Alpine and an Asiatic, the latter extending
like the other steppe animals into the plains of
central Europe; beavers; squirrels; dormice;
etc. These examples may be sufficient to
illustrate the important points in regard to
the rodents&mdash;their destructiveness, their
fertility, and the fact that many were originally
inhabitants of steppes and open plains,
but tend, as man clears the forest-land for his
own purposes, to extend their range to the<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></a>
cleared land, and to appropriate the new and
extensive food-supply furnished by man’s
industry.</p>

<p>While the ungulates, because of the nature
of their food, must almost necessarily be
rather large animals, the carnivores occur
both in large and small forms. The tendency
is for the large forms to be killed out
with the progress of civilisation; thus the lion
has wholly disappeared from Europe, wolf
and bear are almost gone, but a considerable
number of smaller forms still remain, such
as badger, genet, wolverene, lynx, wild cat,
stoat, marten, weasel, etc. The last order to
be mentioned, that of the <i>Insectivores</i>, includes
small mammals, such as moles, shrews,
and hedgehogs, which feed largely on insects,
but may be partially vegetarians.</p>

<p>As was to be expected from the climate and
from the peculiar flora, the Mediterranean
region possesses a richer fauna than central
Europe, both as regards mammals and lower
forms. Even the European portion shows
considerable African influence.</p>

<p>A few words must be said about other land
animals apart from mammals. In regard
to birds it is noticeable that the habit of
migration, and the fact that the greater part<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></a>
of the continent of Europe lies on the direct
line between the northern breeding grounds of
many species and the southern winter quarters,
gives Europe a very rich bird fauna.
The British Islands owe to their peculiarly
mild climate a rich bird fauna at all seasons,
for while the summer climate attracts many
forms for nesting purposes, the mild winter
brings many migrants flying from the cold of
continental Europe.</p>

<p>In regard to birds as well as to other
animals, the Mediterranean owes to its warm
climate a richer fauna than countries farther
north. Some interesting southern forms,
such as pelican, flamingo and ibis, reach this
region, though not extending into central
Europe, except as stragglers.</p>

<p>The climate of Europe is not hot enough
anywhere to lead to the presence of a rich
reptilian fauna, but there is, again, a marked
increase to the south. It is stated that there
are only twenty-one species of reptiles in
central Europe, while there are fifty-nine in
southern Europe, and no less than a hundred
and forty in the Mediterranean region taken
in the large sense. Poisonous forms are few,
and do not, as in hotter countries, constitute
a serious menace to man. Very interesting<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></a>
is the presence of the chameleon in southern
Spain, as in north Africa.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important human aspect
of the European reptiles is the presence of
numbers of insect-eating forms. In the
warmer parts of Europe every wall or patch
of rock seems alive with lizards in the summer
sunshine, and these must play a not inconsiderable
part in the keeping down of noxious
insects.</p>

<p>Omitting a great number of other groups,
we may say something about insects, which
are of enormous importance in human life,
both directly and indirectly.</p>

<p>It has been shown of late years that many
insects are the sole means by which certain
very deadly diseases are transmitted from
man to man, or from one animal to another.
Almost every few months a new announcement
of an insect-carried disease is made, but
the most important forms are the following:&mdash;Mosquitoes
and gnats transmit such diseases
as malaria, yellow fever, and more horrible
diseases still, due to the presence in the blood
of small parasitic worms. Tsetse flies carry
sleeping sickness, and also transmit the very
fatal fly disease of domesticated animals, a
fact which has been and is of great importance<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></a>
in the settlement of Africa. In the case of
most diseases there seems to be a close connection
between one particular species of insect
and a particular disease.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes and gnats are very abundant
in many parts of Europe, and the forms
belonging to the genus Anopheles, which
carry the germ of malaria, are widely distributed.
In parts of the Mediterranean
area their presence is associated with the
prevalence of malaria, which has existed
there for a prolonged period, and is believed
by some to have had an important bearing
upon the fates of the ancient civilisations of
the Mediterranean basin.</p>

<p>The regions in Europe affected, or seriously
affected, by malaria are diminishing yearly.
This is now due to conscious efforts, but a
similar process has been going on probably
for a long period, for many obscure diseases,
notably “ague,” seem to have been forms of
malaria. Their disappearance seems to be
due to drainage, which diminishes the breeding
places of the mosquitoes, and also to the
progress of agriculture, for ponds which
form on rich, well-manured land are apparently
unsuited to mosquito larvæ. The
subject is of great geographical importance,<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"><span class="pagenum">[163]</span></a>
for the spread of man over the surface of the
globe, and the progress of civilisation must
have been influenced in all time by the
prevalence of fly-borne disease. Such diseases
have hitherto been the greatest obstacle
in the way of the civilisation of Africa.</p>

<p>In Uganda extensive tracts of fertile
wooded land have had to be abandoned on
account of the presence there of the tsetse
fly, while, prior to this abandonment, there
were districts in which every living soul had
been destroyed by the deadly sleeping sickness
transmitted by this fly. We can hardly
suppose that such facts are without a parallel
in human history; and man’s distribution
over the surface of the globe, and in detail
the distribution of his settlements within a
country, have doubtless been greatly influenced
by the distribution even of such
insignificant creatures as the various kinds
of flies.</p>

<p>Even apart from their power of transmitting
disease, the blood-sucking flies must have
influenced man in his choice of localities for
settlements, and must have been an important
factor in the process of adjustment
to his surroundings. The naturalist Brehm
gives an appalling picture of the number and<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"><span class="pagenum">[164]</span></a>
blood-thirstiness of the mosquitoes of the
Siberian tundra, which render life almost
intolerable there for both man and beast in
summer. Even within the British Islands
the uncultivated and undrained regions are
often badly infested with small blood-sucking
flies, and their numbers must have been vastly
greater in the old days before drainage and
intensive cultivation had reduced them. It
is quite possible that some of the anomalies
in regard to the spread of particular races
of men over the surface can be explained by
the varying susceptibility of different races
to insect attack, and there can be no doubt
that the blood-sucking insects must have
had some effect in determining the rapidity
or slowness with which particular tracts were
colonised by man.</p>

<p>Apart from the blood-sucking flies, there
are many other interesting points about the
insects of Europe, notably the wealth of
beautiful and striking forms which occur
round the Mediterranean basin. One of
these, which extends northwards and westwards
to northern France, is the curious
Praying Mantis, a predatory insect belonging
to the same order as the locust. It is an eastern
form, which, like so many others, has<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"><span class="pagenum">[165]</span></a>
taken advantage of the mild climate of
western Europe to extend its range far beyond
what we must regard as its natural limits.
In France it shows the effect of relatively
unfavourable conditions in the fact that it
takes some nine to ten months for the eggs
to hatch, whereas in hotter countries the
process may take place in a few weeks.</p>

<p>In the warmer parts of Europe a very
striking feature is the number and large
size of the members of the locust and grasshopper
families, whose shrill noise is so
characteristic a sound in, for example, the
pastures of Switzerland in summer-time.
Among the locusts there occur, in many parts
of Europe, those migratory forms which
possess that power of periodic enormous
multiplication which we have already noted
so frequently among grassland animals. The
migratory instinct only seems to develop
when the numbers have greatly increased in
any given locality, and in Europe generally
the climate does not permit this to take
place. It does, however, occur in the south-east
of the Mediterranean basin, notably in
the island of Cyprus, in Syria, and also in
Northern Africa, where locusts sometimes
reach the dimensions of a plague.</p>

<p><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></a></p>

<p>We may add to this account of land animals
a few details on the land mammals of
North America. The great point of contrast
here is that Europe, from the beginning of
the historic period, has always been a relatively
well-peopled region, while in America,
prior to the advent of the white man, the
population was scanty. There was thus far
more room in North America than in Europe
for great flocks of large mammals. Thus
the plains and prairies carried great herds of
bison, while to the north there were other
herds of reindeer, which were never tamed by
the inhabitants of North America as they
were in the Old World by the Lapps and
others. The musk-ox is another interesting
animal found in the north of America. It
once also lived in Europe, but died out long
ago. Just as the coniferous forest and tundra
in Asia produce many small fur-bearing
animals, so do the forest and tundra of North
America. Deer are present as in the Old
World, though they are of different types,
and there is a curious animal known as the
prong-buck which is peculiar. Wild sheep
occur as they do in Europe, but no wild horse
nor ass roams the plains of America as they
roam to-day the wastes of Asia. Without<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></a>
going into further detail, we may say generally
that as regards wild animals, no less than
as regards wild plants, North America shows
a closer resemblance to Asia than to that
favoured peninsula of Asia which the geographers
call Europe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>CULTIVATED PLANTS AND DOMESTICATED
ANIMALS</h3>


<p>Before proceeding to discuss the chief
races of men in Europe, something must be
said of its cultivated plants and animals.
Originally, doubtless, the various human
groups which have mingled in Europe had
each their own type of culture, based upon
the possession and cultivation of particular
animals and plants. The lapse of time has
caused so complete an intermixture that it
is only possible to a very small extent to disentangle
the different elements which have
gone to the making of present day civilisation.
Nevertheless, as climatic differences
remain and still determine minor differences,
it seems worth while to consider briefly the
distribution of cultivated plants and domesticated
animals at the present day.</p>

<p>Europe has been so strongly influenced by<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></a>
the neighbouring land-masses of which it
forms a part, that we must begin with a few
words about them.</p>

<p>The great continent of Asia, of which
Europe, as we have seen, is but a peninsula,
can be divided into a series of zones, distinguished
alike by climate and by vegetation.
To the north we have the cold tundra
region, passing to the south into the forest
region. The Asiatic forest region is continuous
with that of Europe, but while the European
forest extends southward till Mediterranean
conditions intervene, close to the sea
of that name, the Asiatic forest has its southern
limit in about the latitude of London.
To the south of the Asiatic forest stretches a
zone of steppes passing into desert, and even
into tundra in the elevated regions of Central
Asia. The steppe region, as we have already
indicated, enters Europe by way of Russia and
pushes a long arm up the Danube into
Hungary.</p>

<p>South of the Asiatic steppes and deserts
comes an interrupted band of warm temperate
or tropical forest, luxuriant to the east
where there are summer rains, scanty and
scrub-like to the west, where Asia meets the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></a></p>

<p>The steppes and desert of Asia are populated,
scantily enough, with wandering pastoral
nomads, who constantly tend to overflow
from their own region into those of the
surrounding agricultural populations. These
agricultural populations are concentrated in
three areas, all specially favoured by nature.
To the east the summer rains, the luxuriant
indigenous flora, and the presence of great
river valleys, that is, of naturally fertile regions,
led to the early establishment of agricultural
populations in China and India.
Further to the west, the fertile valleys of the
Tigris and Euphrates early saw the founding
of a great civilisation. This region, the Mesopotamia
of geographers, is very near the third
area, the Mediterranean, though far enough
removed to have a very scanty rainfall, which
made irrigation a necessity for agriculture.
Its inter-relations with the Mediterranean
must have begun early, and, remembering
that part of the Mediterranean itself is in
Asia, we need not stop to discuss the vexed
question as to whether the Mediterranean
civilisation was largely indigenous, or originated
in the continent of Asia. It is often
difficult to ascertain whether plants which
have long been grown in the Mediterranean<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></a>
area, and are well-fitted to it, are really indigenous
there, or were brought to it from
the Mesopotamian countries. There is much
similarity of climatic conditions, and for our
purpose it is sufficient to note that the cultivated
plants of the Mediterranean basin fall
into three main categories. There are, first,
the plants specially adapted to its climate;
these are either native or were introduced
from the countries close at hand. Second,
there are many plants, much less perfectly
adapted to conditions of drought, and therefore
often demanding irrigation in summer,
which were introduced from the Far East,
after they had been cultivated there for long
periods. Thirdly, and much fewer in number,
there are the plants introduced, at a relatively
late date, from America.</p>

<p>Of the first group the most important are
the cereals barley and wheat, and the olive
and the vine. These four have been known
in the area from the earliest times, and they
still form the basis of the diet of Mediterranean
peoples. Bread, olive oil to replace
the butter used by pastoral peoples, wine as a
beverage, with fresh grapes and the dried
forms of raisins and currants, these early made
life possible in the Mediterranean area.</p>

<p><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></a></p>

<p>Barley is older than wheat, and is more
productive but less valuable. It is now
largely grown in the basin of the Mediterranean
as a food for horses, instead of oats
which, like rye, is a cereal not well suited to
the Mediterranean climate. As a bread plant
it was early replaced in the Mediterranean
by wheat, but it is still used to make bread
in some other parts of Europe, <i>e. g.</i> in Scandinavia,
and is also of importance outside
the Mediterranean as the origin of fermented
beverages.</p>

<p>Wheat is the most valuable bread plant
which exists, both on account of its proteid
content and on account of its digestibility.
It demands a warm dry period for ripening,
with much sunshine, and is well adapted to
Mediterranean conditions. Here it is sown
in the autumn, to enable it to take advantage
of the “early and the latter rain,” <i>i. e.</i> the
autumn and spring rains, and ripens early
before the excessive drought of summer sets
in. Like barley it has always been associated
with plough culture, the animal used being
the ox. According to most authorities plough
culture originated in Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>The vine and olive are apparently both
indigenous to the Mediterranean, and both<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"><span class="pagenum">[173]</span></a>
are well adapted to withstand drought. In
regard to the vine there are several interesting
points. To the traveller from the north
it is most familiar in France or Germany,
where it is grown on sunny slopes, usually
terraced to prevent stagnant water from
lying. In the Mediterranean, on the other
hand, it is planted in hollows, or low-lying
ground, which permits of the collection of
water, for it will receive no summer rain.
The vintage is more secure than further north,
and the resistance to the attacks of parasites
is greater, yet, curiously enough, the Mediterranean
countries do not produce the finest
wines. This seems to be partly because the
climate does not permit of the long storage
necessary for maturing to take place. The
cool cellars, so important in the wine industry
further north, are here absent.</p>

<p>To the four plants which we have mentioned
we must add such forms as the fig,
which if not indigenous was of very early introduction;
garlic, greatly valued as a flavouring
matter; various kinds of pulse; sesame;
millet, once widely grown though no longer
important, and flax, known from remote antiquity.</p>

<p>The second group, that comprising plants<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></a>
introduced from the Far East, includes many
valuable fruit trees, which in the region of the
absolutely rainless summer mostly require
irrigation. The peach came from China in
the time of Alexander the Great; the various
citrus fruits, lemon, orange, lime, citron, etc.,
now so characteristic a feature, were introduced
from China or India. India also gave
rice, extensively cultivated during long ages,
and still extensively consumed, though the
facility with which communication with the
East is now effected makes it relatively little
grown, except in the plain of Lombardy,
which is easily irrigated. China sent the
white mulberry, and with it the cultivation
of the silkworm, so important in many regions.
From the Far East also came the
sugar-cane, very important till the recent development
of the sugar beet industry. Cotton
also was probably introduced from the
Far East, which thus supplied many cultivated
plants and has enormously enriched life
for Mediterranean man.</p>

<p>Of the American plants of late introduction
the most interesting is maize, which fed the
somewhat limited indigenous civilisation of
North America. Maize requires a warm
climate with much sunshine, but needs much<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"><span class="pagenum">[175]</span></a>
moisture during its short growing season.
It is not a very valuable cereal, but it is
enormously productive and therefore cheap.
Generally it may be said to be used as food
by man only when necessity compels its
use. It is thus employed by subject races,
<i>e. g.</i> negroes, and by the poor in the warmer
parts of Europe. In the Mediterranean it
is not sufficiently valuable to be grown on
irrigated land, and it will not grow without
irrigation where the summer is rainless.
Where there are summer rains, however, as
in North Italy, or where mountain slopes
increase the rainfall, as in parts of Greece,
or where the land is rendered valueless for
wheat by winter flooding, there maize is
grown. Generally it occurs within the Mediterranean
area wherever the necessary water
occurs naturally or can be supplied cheaply.
It forms a very important part of the food
of the poor in North Italy, for example, but
not in the south, where water is too
costly.</p>

<p>Two other important plants of American
origin are tobacco and the potato. The latter
plant is little grown in the Mediterranean,
but a considerable amount of tobacco is
produced. Another American plant, the<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></a>
prickly pear, besides furnishing an edible
fruit, is important as a hedge plant within
the area.</p>

<p>Cereals in the Mediterranean are grown,
as we have seen, on ploughed land, as elsewhere.
A more characteristic form of cultivation
is garden-culture, practised where
water can be obtained for irrigation. Such
gardens consist primarily of fruit trees, all the
citrus fruits, peaches, apricots, pomegranates,
pistachio, almonds, and many other forms
of nuts, plums, even apples and pears, being
grown in this way. So productive is the
ground once water is supplied, that plants are
grown in association in a fashion hardly suggested
in the north. Thus among the fruit
trees many different kinds of vegetables,
such as garlic, cucumbers, leeks, salad plants,
many sorts of melons, tomatoes, egg-plants,
beans, and peas, etc., are grown. Elsewhere
one may see corn sown beneath the olive
trees, and the vine sharing the same ground
with them.</p>

<p>The picture of Mediterranean life may be
completed by adding a few words about the
domesticated animals. These are naturally
in essence the same as those further north,
but their relative numbers and the uses to
which they are put are different.</p>

<p><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></a></p>

<p>The dog and cat both occur, but the former
has little importance in the pastoral industries,
and is largely a watch animal, insufficiently
fed, and therefore important as a
sanitary agent in that it devours garbage.
Among the ungulates or hoofed animals, the
ass was domesticated in the region long before
the horse, and it and the mule are still
more important than the horse, partly, no
doubt, because both are hardier, and the
problem of food is a difficulty in the largely
pastureless Mediterranean region.</p>

<p>Few camels now occur in Europe, where
they have been always closely associated
with Mahometans, appearing and disappearing
with them.</p>

<p>The pasturage difficulty greatly reduces
the importance of cattle, which are draught
animals rather than a source of food. As
draught animals cattle go back to the dawn
of history, but their numbers are small and
the use of either their flesh or their milk as
food is insignificant. Philippson in his book
on the Mediterranean gives some striking
figures to illustrate the difference in numbers
between the cattle of the Mediterranean
countries and those of Central Europe.
Spain has only 2.1 million cattle, and yet it<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></a>
is scarcely smaller than Germany, which has
19 millions; Switzerland has 1,340,000 head of
cattle, and Greece, which is about half as
large again, has only 360,000. It is to be noted,
however, that the irrigated plains of North
Italy now support a considerable amount of
cattle, whose milk gives rise to a considerable
cheese industry; but, then, the olive will not
grow in North Italy, which is therefore not
strictly within the Mediterranean area.</p>

<p>The Arabs introduced the Indian buffalo
which has spread considerably, and is now
found in South Italy and the Balkan peninsula.
The pig has been banished from parts
of the region on religious grounds, but elsewhere
it chiefly thrives where oak forests
grow, the acorn being an important part of
its food. The really important ungulates,
however, are sheep and goats, which are
often very numerous, and which, apart from
birds and fish, furnish the most important
part of the animal food of the inhabitants.
The milk furnishes cheese, which is an important
element of diet, while leather, wool
and hair are also important products.</p>

<p>The goats chiefly feed upon the young
shoots of shrubs, and frequent the denser
thickets, while the sheep browse upon the<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></a>
grasses and herbs to be found in the more open
forms of maquis. The climate permits the
animals to remain in the open during the
whole year, and this prevents the collection
of the manure for the arable lands. Further,
the summer drought makes it difficult for
even these hardy animals to obtain food, and
necessitates in many regions a curious form
of nomadism, to which the name of transhumance
is given. Transhumance, still well
developed in Spain, is the periodic and alternating
displacement of flocks and herds
between two regions of different climate.</p>

<p>As we have had frequent reason to remark,
the rainlessness of the Mediterranean summer
is locally modified by many causes, notably
by elevation. Mountains may receive frequent
showers, while the plains are parched
and brown, and therefore there may be
pasture on the mountains while there is none
in the plains. On lofty mountains also the
winter snow lingers long enough to promote
the growth of summer pasture. While there
are considerable herds of sheep and goats,
then, it may be necessary for the flocks and
their keepers to travel to the mountains in
summer and back to the plains in winter. In
Spain these periodic migrations, now largely<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"><span class="pagenum">[180]</span></a>
made by means of the railway, formerly
took place by well-defined routes, along which
the immense army of sheep, accompanied
by a smaller army of attendants, passed twice
a year, causing enormous destruction to the
cultivated lands through which they passed.
Everywhere the conflict between shepherd
and husbandman is more or less acute, but it
seems to have been especially acute in Spain,
which is in some respects a link between Africa
and Europe. Its constant liability to Arab
invasion made agriculture especially difficult,
while frequent wars favoured the pastoral
industry; for flocks may be removed to a
place of safety on an alarm, but agriculture
must have some security before it can develop.
In the semi-desert regions of North
Africa some form of pastoral nomadism, with
the social polity which comes from pastoral
nomadism, was the natural result of the
physical and climatic conditions, and Spain,
like the lands of the eastern part of Europe,
has been constantly liable to have its nascent
agriculture destroyed by incursions of such
pastoral nomads. In both cases the slow
victory of the agriculturists, marked by
many temporary reverses, affords an extraordinarily
interesting chapter in human history.<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"><span class="pagenum">[181]</span></a>
A stable civilisation must always be
based upon agriculture, but every disturbance
of an old and stable civilisation has temporarily
encouraged the pastoral as contrasted
with the agricultural industries.</p>

<p>In regard to the other animals of the
Mediterranean, mention need only be made
of the domesticated birds. The fowl has
long been known; it is believed to have been
introduced from the East eight centuries B.C.
Both the eggs and the flesh are of great
importance as a source of food. In spite
of Roman history, geese are relatively unimportant,
as are also ducks, but the turkey,
late introduction from America, is well suited
to the climate and has become important.
Pigeons are everywhere abundant, sometimes
so much so that their manure is extensively
used as a fertiliser. We have already mentioned
silkworms, and students of classical
history know that bees have long been kept.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If we sum up what has been said about
Mediterranean cultivated plants, we may
note that these have been derived partly
from native plants, partly from plants native
to the warm forest country of eastern Asia,
and partly from American plants. Regarding<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"><span class="pagenum">[182]</span></a>
for a moment the Eurasiatic continent as a
whole, we may say that the old civilisations,
both to the east and to the west, arose in the
forest regions&mdash;in the monsoon forests to the
east, in the drought-resisting forest or scrub
of the west. The temperate forest of Asia
has produced no great civilisation, and the
civilisation of the temperate forest zone of
Europe has owed much to the earlier civilisation
of the Mediterranean, with which it has
always had free communication.</p>

<p>This free communication has taken place
chiefly by means of the Mediterranean seaboard
of France, especially by means of the
great Rhone valley, which forms a natural
highway to the north. France, with both
an Atlantic and a Mediterranean seaboard,
has been the natural intermediary between
the Mediterranean scrub land, with its characteristic
civilisation, and the temperate
forest region, with its colder climate, and its
greater rainfall, which produce a corresponding
difference in the cultivated plants.</p>

<p>We have seen that wheat is the great bread
plant of the Mediterranean, and it is interesting
to note that in this respect France is almost
purely Mediterranean. It is, above all,
the country of white bread, which plays a very<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></a>
important part in the dietary of the people.
In ordinary years the country produces nearly
as much wheat as it consumes.</p>

<p>In addition to this large use of wheat as a
bread plant, France shows strong Mediterranean
influence in the part which wine plays
in the dietary of the people, in the variety
of vegetables, especially kinds of pulse, which
are grown; in the fact that fowls and pork
form a large part of the animal food consumed,
and in that flax has been grown in considerable
amounts for long ages, so that linen
is an important part of household wealth.
The Midi is of course definitely Mediterranean
in culture, but just as the vine extends
far to the north and west so also do Mediterranean
influences extend far beyond the region
of Mediterranean climate and Mediterranean
flora.</p>

<p>But fertile as much of France is, it must not
be regarded as consisting of nothing but
fields of waving wheat. To complete and
correct the picture we must add that, as
in Russia, considerable amounts of buckwheat
are grown for use as human food.
Buckwheat, the “black wheat” of the French,
perhaps introduced by the Arabs, is not a
true cereal, but a relative of the knot-grass<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"><span class="pagenum">[184]</span></a>
of British fields. It is very easily grown,
even on poor land, and in France replaces
wheat where the conditions are unfavourable,
or where agriculture is backward. It is not
without interest to note that while its use
in France as human food is an indication of
extreme poverty, in the United States buckwheat
cakes take a place as a luxury. Oatcakes
in lowland Scotland, “black bread”
in well-to-do households in Germany, are
other similar instances of the reappearance
of a despised food-stuff as a luxury. Such
foods become luxuries when they can be used
to supplement, not to replace, white bread.
Most of the buckwheat of France, however,
is now grown as food for domesticated
animals.</p>

<p>Again, fruit trees are extensively grown
in France as in the Mediterranean region, with
a gradual increase in the forms which require
more moisture and less heat as we travel
northwards. The typically Mediterranean
forms early disappear, while many kinds of
plums, pears and apples increase in numbers
and in value. As we travel northwards also,
the various forms of berries, scarcely represented
in the south, increase in importance.
The strawberries of Brittany form a good<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"><span class="pagenum">[185]</span></a>
example, but throughout Europe generally
this change takes place, culminating in the
enormous wealth of wild berries&mdash;cranberries,
whortleberries, and so on, which is a characteristic
feature of the Scandinavian uplands
in late summer.</p>

<p>As we travel to the north-west also, with the
increase in the rainfall and the consequent
increase in pasturage, the number of cattle
increases, and with them the increased use of
beef as food, and the increased use of cows’
milk and milk products. This is well seen in
the broad fields of Normandy, while still further
west, in the British Islands, pastures become
more and more extensive, and only the
existence of a well-marked “rain shadow” on
the eastern seaboard, which is robbed of much
of its rainfall by the hills of the west, makes
the extensive growth of wheat possible in
south-eastern England. With the increase of
pasture, and the increased cold of winter, as
compared with the Mediterranean area, we
have stall-feeding, with the possibility of
collecting manure for the fields. The consequence
is that England, with a climate very
different from that which wheat experiences
elsewhere, has a yield per acre greater than
that of any other country in the world.<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"><span class="pagenum">[186]</span></a>
France, despite her warmth and sunshine,
only gets an average of 19 bushels to the acre
from her wheat fields, while in England, where
wheat can only be grown at a profit when the
conditions are especially favourable, the average
yield is 30 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>In those parts of Europe where the climate
or soil does not suit cereals, even such cereals
as oats and rye, there is a tendency for these
to be partially replaced as the basis of the
diet by plants requiring less sunshine and
tolerant of greater moisture. Thus in Ireland
and North Germany, the potato is a very
important article of diet, while in France and
in Mediterranean regions generally it is
unimportant. Similarly, towards the north
the “fowl in the pot” tends to be replaced
by fish, in the case of those who cannot
afford beef or mutton.</p>

<p>In the more northern regions also, with
their relatively large rainfall, root crops play
a very important part. Most of these are
grown for the domestic animals, as turnips,
mangels, swedes, etc., a phenomenon which
does not occur in the Mediterranean area
to any extent; but the sugar beet, whose
cultivation is spreading greatly in northern<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"><span class="pagenum">[187]</span></a>
and central Europe, is of course grown for
its yield of sugar.</p>

<p>We have seen that wine is the universal
drink through the greater part of France,
and this in spite of the fact that the northern
limit of the vine, so far as wine-making is
concerned, is in France about lat. 47&frac12;°, that
is, about the north of the Loire. In Germany,
the vine reaches to the east, in the Province
of Posen, a latitude of nearly 53° N., owing
to the fact that the summers grow warmer
as we pass eastward. Nevertheless, in Germany,
as a general rule, wine is a luxury, the
influence of Mediterranean culture being less
felt than in France. Throughout Germany,
as throughout northern Europe generally,
wine is replaced by beverages made by the
fermentation of cereals or other plant products
rich in starch. Throughout Germany, as
throughout much of England, beer is the
characteristic drink, and associated with it
we have the growth of hops, used as a flavouring
material. Further north stronger beverages
tend to be used.</p>

<p>Another plant which is widely grown in the
more northerly parts of Europe, especially
in Russia and the Baltic countries, is flax,<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></a>
which, though originally Mediterranean, is
now grown for its fibre chiefly in the north,
partly because it is especially suited for flat
moist land.</p>

<p>Having now looked at the cultivated plants
of the Mediterranean in their bearing on the
life of the inhabitants, and compared with
them the plants cultivated in extra-Mediterranean
areas, let us conclude this chapter by
a few words on the purely pastoral peoples.
These do not now occur in Europe in unmodified
form, but the Asiatic steppes still contain
pastoral folk, diminishing with the progress
of civilisation. There can be no doubt that
such pastoral folk have repeatedly invaded
Europe, and have there undergone modifications
owing to the different conditions which
prevail.</p>

<p>Of pastoral folk in the unmodified form the
Kirghiz of the Asiatic steppes form perhaps
the best example. They are pure nomads,
wandering about in search of pasture for their
numerous herds, and dwelling in a movable
tent, or yurt, which can be readily carried
from one place to another. The herds consist
of horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and camels,
and the females of all these animals are milked.
The Kirghiz do not cultivate land, or only<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></a>
to a very slight extent, and practically do not
eat bread, though flour and rice, obtained by
barter, are employed by the richer. Milk
and milk-products, with the flesh of the flocks,
form the basis of the diet, and a milk-wine or
koumiss, produced by the fermentation of
milk, is the characteristic drink. This brief
description is based upon that of the traveller
Brehm, and as it was written some fifty years
ago, matters have doubtless changed considerably
since, but it remains as the typical
picture of the nomadic pastoral life. In the
smaller spaces of densely populated Europe
it would of course be impossible, and here
pastoral nomadism is mostly replaced by
that modified form known as transhumance
upon which we have already touched.</p>

<p>As the European peoples of Asiatic origin
are specially found on high ground, we may
conclude by contrasting briefly with the
above the life of the pastoral folk of Switzerland.
Here there is no yurt or movable
tent, but the old conditions are suggested by
the fact that each family may possess as
many as four houses. Thus in some of the
valleys tributary to the Rhone in the canton
Valais the following conditions occur.</p>

<p>There is first the true village, where each<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></a>
house is a miniature homestead, with dwelling,
cow-house, hayloft, and granaries or store-houses.
Round about are fields, where rye,
the characteristic cereal, is grown, with some
fodder plants. Higher up the valley is the
spring pasture or “mayen,” whither the cows
are driven in May, to feed until the alps or
high pastures are clear of snow. At the
mayen there are cow-houses, and also human
habitations, though not of an elaborate type.
Further up, again, there are necessarily huts
near the high pastures, whither a few men only
go with the cows as herds, and where the
cheese is made. The fourth village is placed
on the hot plain of the Rhone valley, and here
are the vineyards whose produce gives the
much-prized wine, and orchards which yield
fruit. We find here therefore a curious combination
of pastoral and agricultural life.
Mostly of the race called Alpine, believed
to be of Asiatic origin, these Swiss folk have
borrowed the vine and the use of wine from
the Mediterranean peoples. The large part
played in their diet by milk products, especially
various forms of cheese, must be an
inheritance from their nomad ancestors, while
the rye, which is their bread plant, is also
a heritage from Asiatic ancestors. The<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></a>
occurrence of four sets of dwellings instead
of a movable one is an adaptation to life in a
settled community, confined to a limited
space. The whole social polity is thus a
curious example of a transitional condition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have thus, in successive chapters, shown
that in Europe three chief zones of vegetation
exist, the Mediterranean scrub land, the temperate
forest zone, the steppe or pasture land,
and that as each of these is determined by
climate, each, again, has special types of
cultivated plants and domesticated animals,
involving a special social polity in each case.
Now it is interesting to note, what cannot be
a pure coincidence, that in Europe three
races of men exist, which show a certain
rough correspondence to the three zones of
vegetation.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean type of vegetation and
climate is associated with a particular race,
to which the name of Mediterranean has been
given. The race is by no means confined to
the Mediterranean region&mdash;we find representatives
of it, <i>e. g.</i> in western Ireland,&mdash;nor
does it occupy the whole of that region, for
in many places it is pressed hard by other
races, but it reaches its fullest development<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"><span class="pagenum">[192]</span></a>
within the Mediterranean basin. Curiously
enough, also, its presence in western Ireland
is associated with the presence of certain
representatives of the Mediterranean flora,
notably the arbutus or strawberry tree and
St. Dabeoc’s heath.</p>

<p>The characteristic inhabitants of the temperate
forest region of Europe are the members
of the race called Teutonic or Nordic,
whose particular type of civilisation is deeply
stamped by the lessons they learnt in their
early struggle with the forest.</p>

<p>Finally, the steppe and pasture lands,
whether in parts of Russia, in the Hungarian
plain, or in the Alps and in the uplands of
Brittany and Central Europe, etc., tend to
be occupied by a third race, which seems to
have originated in the steppes of Asia, and
to which the somewhat inappropriate name
of Alpine has been given, though it occurs in
lowlands to the east as well as in uplands to
the west. This race seems to be accompanied
throughout Europe by plants and animals of
Asiatic origin.</p>

<p>The full meaning of this association between
racial peculiarities and types of vegetation
cannot perhaps be formulated meantime,
but it is interesting to note that there are<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"><span class="pagenum">[193]</span></a>
some curiously close connections between
human life and the distribution of vegetation.
For instance, all travellers in Switzerland
must have been struck by the curious fact
that in following up the Rhone valley from
the lake of Geneva to the Rhone glacier the
French language is found to extend up to the
town of Sion, and beyond, without any
obvious cause, German prevails. It has been
pointed out recently that the eastward
extension of the French language here marks
also the eastward extension of the sweet
chestnut&mdash;a curious coincidence.</p>

<p>Again, the same writer points out that the
battle-ground between the French and German
peoples round the Rhine is the region
where the growth of the sweet chestnut as a
planted tree reaches its eastward limit. Such
facts must not, of course, be over-emphasised.
Both must indicate a climatic change, but it
can hardly be supposed that this change of
climate is sufficient to affect man directly. It
seems at least justifiable to point out that
every human group which reaches any degree
of civilisation and stability must depend for
its permanence in the early stages on some
special skill in the growing of certain cultivated
plants, and the rearing of certain domesticated<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"><span class="pagenum">[194]</span></a>
animals. We have much reason to
believe that this skill is often difficult to acquire
by other groups. The great difficulties
which have been experienced in introducing
<i>e. g.</i> Smyrna figs and dates into the United
States; the fact that Europeans seem to find
it impossible to manage camels without
native help, and that they have been hitherto
unable, despite most elaborate and costly
experiments, to tame the African elephant,
seem to be minor illustrations of this fact.
Given, then, an evolving group spreading over
the surface of the globe, and taking with it its
characteristic plants and animals, it is probable
enough that such a change of climate,
even a minor change, as may be sufficient to
render it impossible to cultivate these plants,
or to rear these animals, may give a definite
and more or less permanent check to the
spread of the race. There is at least some
evidence to this effect, and it gives an additional
interest to the study of plant geography.</p>

<p>We have limited ourselves in this chapter
practically to a consideration of the European
area, because the existing cultivated plants
and domesticated animals of North America<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></a>
are almost all derived from Europe, with the
exceptions already indicated, and a few others
not of great importance, and their distribution
in America is determined by the same
conditions as in Europe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE RACES OF EUROPE AND THEIR
ORIGIN</h3>


<p>We have spoken in the previous chapter
of the three chief races of Europe, but before
proceeding to discuss them in detail it is
necessary to clear the ground of certain
misconceptions and difficulties.</p>

<p>The first of these is the notion that nationality
has anything to do with race, in the
anthropological sense. There is much to be
said for the view that the European civilisations
owe their development largely to the
mingling of races which has occurred within
the area; it is at least certain that no European
nation, whatever the fervour of its
citizens’ patriotism, is of anthropologically
pure race. There is no British race, no
French race, no German race, even though the
word Germanic is sometimes applied to one
of the strains which occurs in the German<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"><span class="pagenum">[197]</span></a>
Empire. We recognise this fact, of course, in
our popular language, for the contrast between
the Briton of Saxon race and the
Briton of Celtic race is a favourite literary
topic. Unfortunately for accuracy, the people
within the British area who speak Celtic
languages are not all of the same race, and
there is nothing more certain than the fact
that few of them, if any, have any distinct
trace of Celtic blood. Although in literature
also the comparison between the “Celts” of
Brittany and the “Celts” of Wales and
western Great Britain generally is a favourite
one, upon which many deductions have been
based, it is certain that the Bretons are not
homogeneous, and that they have language
but not race in common with the dark-haired
Welsh.</p>

<p>This naturally leads us to the second point
of importance&mdash;that language has nothing
to do with race. In his book on the <i>Races of
Europe</i>, Ripley illustrates this in a very
interesting way by a consideration of the
languages and races of the Iberian Peninsula.
This peninsula shows at the present time
relative purity of race&mdash;not absolute purity,
for a mingling has certainly occurred, but
nevertheless one race, that which we have<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></a>
called Mediterranean, enormously predominates.
Yet in spite of this relative purity of
race, the peninsula is divided between two
nationalities and no less than three languages.
Portugal forms a separate nation with its own<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"><span class="pagenum">[199]</span></a>
language, while Spain, though forming one
nation, has two languages, Castilian or
Spanish, and Catalan. Catalan is nearly
related to Langue d’oc, the language of
Provence across the French border. Provençal
again, before its gradual displacement
by the Langue d’oeil, or true French,
was spoken by men of the Mediterranean as
well as of the Alpine race. Within both
French and Spanish territory still another
language, Basque, is spoken.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig_13" id="Fig_13"></a>
<img src="images/i013.png" width="450" height="468" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;The Iberian Peninsula and part of France, to show
the distribution of languages, and their independence of political
boundaries. (After Ripley.)</span>
</div>

<p>In other words, the almost uniform race of
the Iberian peninsula speaks four separate
tongues, the Portuguese, Castilian, Catalan,
and Basque languages, and the political
boundary of the Pyrenees separates at its
eastern end two groups of Mediterranean
man, speaking similar languages, Catalan or
Provençal, the latter of which is also spoken,
or was spoken, in France by the men of
another race, the Alpine, found in the uplands
of southern and central France, as well as
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Ripley’s explanation of the heterogeneity
of language combined with homogeneity of
race in Spain and Portugal is interesting.
The peninsula was peopled from Africa before
the dawn of history, by a division of the<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"><span class="pagenum">[200]</span></a>
Mediterranean race called Iberian, which
traversed the Strait of Gibraltar. This race
established itself firmly in the peninsula
and has persisted there despite infusions of
other races from the north and north-east.
But the road from Africa remained open, and
the region was constantly liable to new invasions
from the area of its prime origin.
Differences of culture produced fierce warfare
between the incoming and the old established
race, and led temporarily to the triumph of
the invaders, known to history as Saracens
and Moors. The original Iberians, like the
people of the same stock in Wales and parts
of the Scottish Highlands, were pushed back
to the mountains of Galicia, to the hill country
of Castile, to the hills of Aragon and round
and over the Pyrenees to Languedoc and the
south of France generally. Ultimately they
reasserted themselves, and drove the Moors
out of Europe, but the driving force was
exerted from three different centres, Galicia,
Castile, and Aragon, which, owing to the
configuration of the country, were isolated
from each other. A political accident united
Castile and Aragon, and imposed Castilian
Spanish on a united Spain as the official
language, but the geographical conditions<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></a>
have led to the long retention of the Catalan
speech, though not of a Catalan nation.
The Iberians who found a refuge in the
mountains of Galicia, at a later date, formed
the nucleus of the Portuguese nation.</p>

<p>With these preliminary considerations we
may pass to the discussion of what is known,
or surmised, as to the different races of
Europe and their origin.</p>

<p>The earliest man who has left traces in
Europe is he of the Palæolithic Period, or
Old Stone Age, a hunter and cave-dweller
without domesticated animals, whose traces
are especially found in southern Europe.
No traces of his presence have yet been found
in Scandinavia or in Scotland, where the
climatic conditions perhaps made his existence
impossible. Not much is known of this
early race, but it seems to have been long-headed,
and was probably dark. It is no
longer believed that there was a complete
rupture between the culture of the Palæolithic
period, with its unpolished stone implements,
and that of the Neolithic age, with
its polished implements, but the relations of
the two remain somewhat uncertain. The
remains of the Neolithic period are much
more extensive and enable us to draw much<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></a>
more satisfactory conclusions as to racial
characters. We shall describe briefly some
of these Neolithic remains as they appear
in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Before doing this, however, it is necessary
to say a few words about the means of recognising
different races of men. The criterion
most employed is that of head form, and
especially what is known as the cephalic
index, that is, the ratio between the breadth
of the skull between the ears and its length
from front to back. The ratio is expressed
as a percentage, the length being taken as
100, and the breadth stated as a fraction of
it. When the index rises above 80, the skull
is said to be brachycephalic, or rounded;
when it is below 75, the skull is long, or dolichocephalic.
The Italian anthropologist,
Sergi, adopts another classification of skulls,
based upon the shape, but this is only a refinement
of the ordinary distinction between
long and round skulls.</p>

<p>Another important character, which, like
the shape of the skull, can be measured either
in the living person or in the skeleton, is the
height, which has some racial significance.
A third character, of much importance, is
the colouring of the skin, eyes and hair.<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></a>
This can only be inferred in the case of pre-historic
peoples. Finally, the shape of the
features, especially of the nose, has some
racial significance.</p>

<p>In the west of Great Britain generally, and
extending northwards to Orkney, there occur
the burying-places of a Neolithic people,
which have yielded abundant remains, including
skeletons. The cairns, tumuli, or barrows
of this people are recognised by their elongated
shape, by the fact that they are chambered,
and by the contained skeletons, which
are always those of a dolichocephalic people.
“Long barrows, long skulls” is an anthropological
rule for England and Scotland, no less
than for the other parts of Europe in which
these tumuli occur. The skeletons within
the barrows show no marks of fire, so that
inhumation not cremation was practised, and
a very curious feature found in Scotland, in
Sicily, in Egypt and elsewhere, in tombs
supposed to be of similar age, is that the body
is usually placed in a doubled-up position.
The position corresponds to the pre-natal
position of the human infant, and this method
of burial is supposed to imply some belief in a
future life&mdash;is a record of a naïve hope that
man could “enter a second time into his
mother’s womb and be born again.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></a></p>

<p>Graves of this type, containing the skeletons
of long-headed men, believed to be of the
race which we have called Mediterranean,
occur not only in western Great Britain, but
also in France, in Scandinavia, in Germany,
in the Mediterranean basin, and elsewhere.
There seems reason to believe that they prove
that in Neolithic times the Mediterranean
race was widely distributed, especially in the
west; it seems, further, tolerably certain that
Mediterranean man himself was an immigrant
from the north of Africa, and established
himself first in the Mediterranean basin.</p>

<p>The members of this race have now, and
apparently have always had, the following
characters:&mdash;The skull is markedly dolichocephalic,
the skin tends to be brown, the
eyes and hair are dark, the stature is medium
and the build slight, and the nose is rather
broad.</p>

<p>According to Prof. Sergi there are four
great stocks of this race; of these, one
remained within Africa, and has been known
under various names, the ancient Egyptians,
the Libyans, the Berbers being all of this
stock. The other three stocks invaded Europe,
entering by the three natural routes
which present themselves, that is, by the<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"><span class="pagenum">[205]</span></a>
three regions where the sea is most easily
crossed. The most western group, the Iberians,
crossed, as we have seen, <i>via</i> Gibraltar,
and occupied the Iberian peninsula. The
next group, the Ligurians, found an entrance
into Europe <i>via</i> Sicily, and passing up into
Italy extended westwards along the Riviera,
till they encountered the Iberians in southern
France.</p>

<p>Finally, the third group, the Pelasgians,
reached Greece by means of the islands of
that part of the Mediterranean. It still
remains uncertain whether an earlier migration
still had peopled Europe with Palæolithic
man, who, on this theory, would belong
also to the Mediterranean race, or whether
the immigrant African race displaced some
earlier unrelated population. In any case,
it is tolerably certain that the first peopling
of Europe on any considerable scale was
the result of this immigration of Mediterranean
man.</p>

<p>He doubtless first established himself on
the margin of the great sea, and there became
thoroughly suited to his environment. Later
he spread northwards, being no doubt especially
attracted by the relatively mild climate
of the west, by what has been called the<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"><span class="pagenum">[206]</span></a>
“winter gulf of warmth” which extends
over north-western Europe.</p>

<p>Whatever was the cause of his northward
trend, however, Mediterranean man does not
appear to have been left long in undisturbed
possession of his acquired territory. In Scotland,
in the Clyde valley, which is typical of
many other parts of Europe, round barrows
or cairns are found side by side with the long
ones. These are of later origin, as is shown
by the nature of the pottery, by the occurrence
of ornaments, and especially by the
presence of bronze weapons&mdash;a great advance
upon stone. The skeletons in these cairns
mostly show marks of fire, suggesting that
cremation was practised, and the skulls are
those of a round-headed race. “Round
barrows mean round skulls” is a second
anthropological maxim for Britain.</p>

<p>These barrows are the first traces of the
second great European race, called Alpine,
Celtic, Eurasiatic, or Celto-Slavic by different
anthropologists. The members of this
race are of medium height, but are more
stoutly built than Mediterranean man.
Though generally resembling him in the coloration
of hair and eyes, they are lighter in tint,
the hair tending to be chestnut-coloured, and<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></a>
the eyes hazel grey, instead of both being very
dark as in the former race. The nose, though
variable, is in living types usually rather
broad, and the special feature is of course the
round head and broad face. As one of the
names given indicates, this race is supposed
by most anthropologists to have been of
Asiatic origin.</p>

<p>Where the two sets of barrows occur there
are indications that the incoming race greatly
influenced the culture of the old. The use
of bronze must have given its members an
enormous advantage in the struggle for existence,
and they seem to have imposed their
customs, burial and other, and apparently
also their language, on the older race.</p>

<p>This conflict of races which has left its
traces in the Clyde valley apparently occurred
in other parts of Europe. Everywhere the
new race imposed its language and its customs
upon the old, and everywhere its appearance
is associated with a change and a rise in culture.
It is presumed by the majority that this
Alpine race brought with it the use of bronze,
and was therefore at a higher level than
Mediterranean man, but Prof. Sergi believes
that the appearance of bronze and of the new
race simultaneously was a mere coincidence,<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></a>
and that the Mediterranean race itself originated
the use of metals. Meantime there
is no means of deciding this question, which
in any case is not of supreme importance, but
what seems clear is that everywhere, except
in the Mediterranean basin, the new race
pressed the old one hard, whether by its skill
in the arts of peace or in those of war remains
uncertain. Even in the Mediterranean the
old languages went down before that of
Alpine man.</p>

<p>In the Mediterranean area the new-comers
seized the upland regions, that is, as we have
suggested, the regions of pasture, and ousted
the longheads permanently from them. In
Spain and Portugal, perhaps because of the
vicinity of the reservoir of the race in North
Africa, Mediterranean man kept his hold,
and the brachycephalic forms did not succeed
in obtaining much foothold. But they are
strongly represented in parts of southern
France. In southern Italy, in Sicily, Corsica
and Sardinia Mediterranean man largely
kept out the intruders, though they appear
again on the Alpine slopes of the north of
Italy. But in the eastern Mediterranean
the dark longheads are hard pressed and
have kept little save the seaboard from the
broadheads.</p>

<p><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></a></p>

<p>Outside the Mediterranean area, the success
of Alpine man was more checkered, but we
are met with the difficulty that here a third
race supervened later, so that existing conditions
are not necessarily comparable to
earlier conditions.</p>

<p>At the present time Alpine man occupies
almost all the upland and therefore relatively
infertile regions of France, especially Savoy
and the Dauphiny, the central uplands, and
parts (not the whole) of Brittany. Outliers
of this race also occur in other regions, <i>e. g.</i>
in parts of the Saône valley, which is not
infertile. In Great Britain, despite their first
success, the broadlands have left little trace
on the existing population. We thus see the
absurdity of talking about British Celts, for
Celts in the true sense are almost extinct in
Britain though their language remains and is
spoken by types of Mediterranean man as
well as by others. In Scandinavia Alpine
man was more successful, for he has left
traces in various parts, especially on the coast
of Norway. Throughout Belgium and in
Southern Germany the broad-headed element
in the population is very strong, while in
Austria, the Balkan States and Russia this
race predominates and is no longer confined<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"><span class="pagenum">[210]</span></a>
to elevated or infertile regions. This increase
in numbers and in dominance towards
the east is one of the facts which lead anthropologists
to believe that Alpine man is of
Asiatic origin.</p>

<p>We shall return to him in a moment, but
meantime it is necessary to speak of the third
element in Europe, the race variously called
Nordic, Teutonic, or even Germanic, in spite
of the fact that many Germans belong to the
Alpine race. The members of this race are
remarkable for their tall stature, for their
long skulls and face, for their blue eyes and
fair hair, their light complexions, and their
narrow aquiline noses. The resemblance in
skull form leads many anthropologists to
regard them as derived from a common stock
with the Mediterranean race, but the race
seems to have originated in Europe. The
place and date of its origin are still quite uncertain.
It is possible that it was produced
from an early form of the Mediterranean race
in adaptation to the moist climate of western
Europe. Ripley gives Scandinavia as the
probable place of origin, but meantime there
can be no certainty.</p>

<p>What we do know is that this race shows
as perfect an adaptation to the climate of<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></a>
forest-clad temperate Europe as Mediterranean
man does to the dry climate of that
region. Just as the border of the Mediterranean
is the province of Mediterranean man,
and has been his for countless ages, so north-western
Europe is the almost unchallenged
possession of Nordic man. Between the two,
along the great wedge of uplands, is the land
of Alpine man, which widens to the east,
his original home. Just as Mediterranean
man in the days of his prime pushed north
wherever conditions permitted, so Nordic man
has pushed south, across the Alpine barrier,
both in the literal and anthropological sense,
and has left traces of his coming even within
the territory of Mediterranean man. Just as
the dark-haired Welsh and the dark-haired
strain of Scottish Highlanders bear witness to
the old exploits of Mediterranean man, so do
the fair-haired, tall-statured Lombards bear
witness to the former activity of Nordic man.
Nevertheless, the main territory of the two
races is widely separated.</p>

<p>The relation of these two types, at least,
to their zones of distribution is relatively easy
to explain. Mediterranean man is highly
susceptible to diseases of the breathing-organs
to which the fair-haired Nordic type is more<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></a>
resistant. Here is one possible explanation
of their command of their respective habitats,
and there are many others. The forest-dwelling
Nordic type, as Prof. Penck points
out, must necessarily have had the family
as the unit, for only by dwelling in small
family groups can primitive man war against
the forest. Mediterranean man, with his
early use of irrigation, had necessarily to
evolve a larger unit, for irrigation means
extensive co-operation, so that political organisations
would arise early in the Mediterranean.
We can hardly doubt that these
two facts had some bearing on the survival
rate of the two races. The Nordic race with
their strong family life, and with their abundant
pasturage, had doubtless a relatively
low death-rate among the children, though, as
Prof. Myres points out, the struggle in adult
life must have been keen. In the Mediterranean,
as he also notes, the dry summer means
difficulties with the water supply, difficulties
in sanitation, and the risk of pestilence, which,
with the abundant supply of fruit and the
absence or scarcity of milk, has probably
always meant a very high death-rate among
the children. But the fact that the struggle
for existence among adults was much less keen<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></a>
than among the forest folk, perhaps prevented
this high infantile death-rate from being a
great handicap. Once the geographical surroundings
of the two peoples were changed
by migration, the qualities which aided them
to survive in their native habitat might become
a positive hindrance. In brief, as two
types evolved in harmony with well-defined
geographical conditions, the very perfectness
of their respective adaptations would hinder
either from appropriating the territory of the
other, while leaving a considerable margin
for struggle on the debatable land between
the two geographical regions.</p>

<p>If it seems at the present day that the
Nordic race has more than passed the Mediterranean
in the race of life, we must remember
that the fact that coal is chiefly found
in the territory of the former, has given it an
enormous economic advantage in recent
times, an advantage which it may not be able
to keep.</p>

<p>The Alpine race presents a much more
difficult problem. We have said nothing here
of the so-called Aryan problem, because the
whole conception of an Aryan race advancing
from Asia with a ready-made culture, and
imposing it upon a barbarian Europe, is somewhat<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"><span class="pagenum">[214]</span></a>
out of date, and much that has been
written on the subject of the Aryans preceded
in time the disentanglement of the
complex problems presented by European
races. But with all deductions made, the
incoming Asiatic race which we have called
Alpine presents many curious problems. It
seems probable that the languages of Europe
are largely due to the grafting of Alpine or
Eurasian tongues upon the different tongues
already spoken by Mediterranean man. We
have still in Britain a Celtic language, though
it is spoken by people of Mediterranean
characters, and it is an extraordinary fact
that a people should impose its language
and culture upon another race, and yet be
itself unable to keep its footing among that
race.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the new-comers,
in Britain at least, were never more than an
aristocracy, and that they disappeared by the
mingling of their blood with the indigenous
people, after having long dominated them.
That is, it was as if we might suppose that
the British population in India was cut off
from the mother country, and ultimately
disappeared owing to intermarriage, while
their language and their customs remained<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"><span class="pagenum">[215]</span></a>
in greatly modified form and replaced the
existing languages and customs.</p>

<p>The difficulties in regard to this hypothesis
are twofold. In the first place, such a hypothesis
of mingling seems inconsistent with the
extraordinary persistency which this race has
manifested in other parts of Europe, where it
came into contact with the same races as in
Britain; and, second, the position of the
Alpine race in western Europe generally, its
virtual limitation to relatively infertile land,
seems inconsistent with the notion that it ever
formed an aristocracy, apart from and above
the other races. To-day in Germany it is so
far from occupying the position of an aristocracy
that it sometimes forms the lower
classes to a Nordic dominant class, though
the Alpine race is sometimes stated to be
better adapted to town life than the Nordic.</p>

<p>Of the three races, Mediterranean man
seems to be perfectly adapted to a dry region,
with deficient pasture, naturally clothed with
a drought-resisting type of forest. As he
prospered he spread beyond his own region,
with the result that he reached a region
markedly different in climate and vegetation
from his own, to which his adaptation was
never very perfect. Where, as in Ireland and<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></a>
western Great Britain, the conditions permitted
the natural growth of some of the
Mediterranean plants, there his hold was
fairly firm, elsewhere it must always have
been loose and uncertain.</p>

<p>Into a Europe thus peopled, with probably
large vacant spaces, came a pastoral type of
man from Asia, certainly a transporter, if not
an originator, of a higher culture, best fitted
for a region of pasture land, but better fitted
than Mediterranean man to withstand cold.
He filled the spaces which Mediterranean
man could not fill, and pressed him hard in
many places. Ultimately the forest region of
Europe evolved its own type, perhaps from
some aberrant strain of Mediterranean man,
and this type, perfectly fitted to the forest
regions, conquered the north and west,
driving Alpine man up to the hills, and largely
displacing Mediterranean man except where
distinctively Mediterranean influences prevailed.</p>

<p>To the east, as the European forest dies
away into the steppes of Asia, Nordic man
can no longer compete successfully with
Alpine man, and diminishes in numbers and
in strength.</p>

<p>Thus while in Germany the tendency is<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></a>
for the tall, fair longheads of the north to
dominate the short, darker broadheads of the
south, further to the east this same broad-headed
race, under the banner of Panslavism,
strives, not unsuccessfully, to dominate the
longheads of Finland and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thus below and beneath the warfare of race
is the contrast of physical conditions, which
have produced the various types of man, no
less than of plants and animals, and from
which man cannot fully emancipate himself.</p>

<p>The New World was first colonised by
Mediterranean man, but later all the European
races contributed their part to its
peopling. When we add a strong negro
element in the southern United States, a
remnant of the original Indian population,
and an infusion of eastern races, it is obvious
that the mingling of blood which has apparently
produced good results in Europe, is
being carried out on a much more elaborate
scale across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>One other point may be touched upon. We
have shown that the nations of Europe are not
races in the pure sense. But, at the same
time, it may be noted that in the western
nations one or other of the two chief races
tends to predominate at the expense of the
other.</p>

<p><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></a></p>

<p>Thus broadly we may say that the antagonism
between the French and German
nationalities is fed by the fact that in race,
in culture, in tradition, the one is predominantly
Mediterranean, and the other
predominantly Teutonic. In the Iberian peninsula,
as we have seen, the Mediterranean
strain enormously predominates, while in the
countries of the north-west the Teutonic race
tends to overbalance the other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE DISTRIBUTION OF MINERALS AND THE
LOCALISATION OF INDUSTRIES AND OF TOWNS</h3>


<p>The distribution of minerals over the surface
of the earth is much less obvious phenomenon
than that of plants and animals,
but it has always been of great importance in
determining the distribution of man and his
settlements. Except in the most primitive
communities man must have tools and implements;
probably never since he became
man has he been without weapons. The first
sign of emergence from the rudest barbarism
is the use of metals, instead of stone or bone,
to construct these tools and weapons and
the necessity for finding the metals best suited
to his use at each stage of civilisation has
always influenced the movements and settlements
of man. The existence of useful metals
in a particular area must always attract<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"><span class="pagenum">[220]</span></a>
population to that spot, and it is obvious in
the case of Australia, of California, and later
of Alaska, how strong the attractive power of
metals is, even when the other conditions are
distinctly unfavourable. As metals have
always had this attractive power, the study
of their distribution must always be important
to the geographer.</p>

<p>We have seen that the first men whose
remains have been preserved in Europe used
only implements of stone, but that at a later
state bronze was used, and corresponded to a
marked rise in civilisation, as shown by the
improved pottery, the nature of the ornaments
used, and so on.</p>

<p>Now bronze is not a metal but an alloy or
mixture of two metals, copper and tin. This
alloy is very hard, and possesses qualities
which make it more valuable for weapons and
tools than the relatively soft metal copper.
But we can hardly suppose that the first
metal-workers discovered, immediately after
they had learnt how to smelt metals, that a
mixture of metals was more useful than a
pure one. In point of fact, it is clear that in
some places, at least, the age of bronze was
preceded by a period when developing man
used pure copper for his implements.</p>

<p><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"><span class="pagenum">[221]</span></a></p>

<p>Our word copper is derived from the name
of the island of Cyprus, which is particularly
rich in copper ores. In this island they were
smelted at a very early date, the process
being aided by two facts, first, that copper
ores are relatively easy to smelt, and, second,
that the necessary fuel for the process was
furnished by the forests which formerly covered
the island, and which were largely destroyed
by the early smiths.</p>

<p>For our purpose it is quite unnecessary to
discuss the difficult and debated question as
to where the use of copper and bronze originated.
It is sufficient to note that the island
of Cyprus, placed near early centres of civilisation
seems to have been the region from
which a knowledge of the pure metal and of
its more useful alloy radiated over the Mediterranean
and ultimately over Europe generally.
It is more than probable that the use
of copper or of bronze spread faster than the
knowledge of the method of producing either.
It is at least clear that in many cases the
Stone and Bronze Ages co-existed, suggesting
that the new type of implements was at
first very difficult to obtain. No doubt for
long ages they occupied the position which
firearms long occupied among savage races,<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"><span class="pagenum">[222]</span></a>
and which they still occupy among those
most remote from civilisation.</p>

<p>In Cyprus itself very few stone implements
occur, suggesting that the Stone Age was very
short, and rapidly gave place to a metal one.</p>

<p>We do not know how the discovery was
made that the addition of tin improved copper
for human purposes. Bronzes of very
varying composition have been found, including
many which contain antimony, a
somewhat rare metal, still employed in making
many useful alloys. It is suggested that
the first smiths tried a great number of combinations
before they found one which was
satisfactory, and finally fixed upon tin as the
most suitable addition.</p>

<p>The next point of interest is the source of
the tin. This is a question of great interest,
for long after iron had been used, and used
extensively in the manufacture of implements,
the demand for bronze continued, for the iron,
even of late Roman days, was very costly
and probably very troublesome to make.
Bronze also became of importance in connection
with the coinage of civilised nations.</p>

<p>Tin is not a very abundant metal, and it is
rare in the Mediterranean. The deposits
which were utilised by the first makers of<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"><span class="pagenum">[223]</span></a>
bronze have doubtless completely disappeared,
for from the early days of civilisation the tin
deposits even of Far Britain were sought.</p>

<p>Within the Mediterranean region at the
present time only one tin deposit of any
importance is known. This occurs in the
village of Montecatini, which is situated near
Volterra in Italy, in the ancient Etruria. It
perhaps played a part in connection with the
development of the civilisation of ancient
Etruria.</p>

<p>Outside of the Mediterranean the main
deposits of tin in Europe occur, or occurred,
in three separate areas, which formed as it
were three stages in one journey, and whose
position certainly made them a factor in
promoting the spread of Mediterranean culture
to the north-west.</p>

<p>These three rich tin-bearing areas were:
(1) Galicia in north-western Spain, (2) the
south of Brittany, especially between the
estuaries of the Loire and the Vilaine, a deposit
long since exhausted, and (3) the still-important
deposits of southern England, in
Cornwall and parts of Devon, which are believed
to have been visited by the Phœnicians.
Just as the gold of California brought
population and civilisation to the Far West<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></a>
of North America long before the natural
increase of eastern peoples would have led to
a westward movement, so the rich tin deposits
of south-western Britain, with the other metals
of those favoured islands, brought merchants
and navigators to what was the Far West of
ancient Europe.</p>

<p>The bold navigators who had learnt their
craft in the Mediterranean Sea left its basin
by the Strait of Gibraltar, and visited successively
those masses of ancient rocks which
project out into the ocean, and form the
western extremities of Spain, France and
Britain. But it was not only the sea route
which was utilised, at least in later times.
Perhaps so long ago as five centuries before
our era a land route was organised which
carried British tin to Marseilles, and thus to
the Mediterranean. The great valley of the
Rhone renders such a traverse of France
feasible, and the passage from the valley to
the Rhone to that of the Loire or of the Seine
is easy. The existence of a commerce in tin
thus ensured that France was early and
deeply permeated by Mediterranean civilisation,
for it involved the existence of high
roads through her land, at a time when northern
Europe generally was cut off from the civilisation<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></a>
of the Mediterranean. There is even
reason to believe that trade in tin led to the
founding of an early maritime power on the
barren shores of Brittany. The trade in tin
certainly did much to open the way for the
future civilisation of France.</p>

<p>Though, as we have indicated, bronze was
for long of relatively great importance, yet
the use of iron dates back to great antiquity.
It seems to have been a rare and precious
metal when the Homeric poems took shape,
and for long afterwards its use was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'parial'">partial</ins>
and limited. The fact, however, that it is
very readily destroyed by rust when exposed
to air and damp, makes it difficult to draw
any certain conclusions from its absence in
ancient remains.</p>

<p>The slow growth of the use of iron must be
largely ascribed to the great difficulties in
smelting it, especially when it occurs in
impure forms. Iron does not occur in the
pure state, as copper does to a small extent,
but it is enormously abundant, being found,
to a greater or less extent, in almost all rocks.
Relatively pure ores are rare, most iron-bearing
minerals containing a large number
of impurities, some of which are very difficult
to remove. Further, the process of<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></a>
smelting always requires much fuel, and, in
the case of the more impure ores, remarkable
skill and science. The result was that the
early smiths could only employ a very high
grade of ore; all others were useless to them.
Even with a high grade of ore, they could
only extract a relatively small amount of
the iron present.</p>

<p>A very curious little proof of this latter
fact is furnished by the Roman iron workings
in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire.
The refuse thrown out of the ancient furnaces
worked by the Romans here, was re-smelted
by the British smiths long centuries
afterwards, and this refuse fed their furnaces
for a period of between two and three hundred
years.</p>

<p>The next point of interest in regard to iron
is the source of the necessary fuel. At first
wood or charcoal was always employed, and
therefore iron could only be smelted in the
vicinity of forests. Thus the Forest of Dean,
already mentioned, supplied the wood used
by the Romans in smelting, and the trees of
the Weald or “wood” of Sussex and Kent
were completely removed during the long
centuries when the iron ores of that region
were smelted. The Forest of Arden, near<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></a>
Birmingham, is another region where iron
was long smelted by the aid of charcoal. The
amount of fuel required, especially in the
early days, was very great, and as the forests
were cleared without any regard for scientific
forestry, it naturally followed that in many
districts the destruction of the necessary fuel
led to a diminution of the industry.</p>

<p>In England coal was not generally employed
in the smelting of iron until after the
middle of the eighteenth century, and long
before that the British forests had been
largely destroyed. The result was that the
British iron industry had declined, and in the
early part of that century considerably more
iron was imported than was made in England.
The countries which at this time were
specially favoured in connection with the industry
were those in which pure iron ores co-existed
with extensive forests. This condition
occurred especially in Germany, where
the iron deposits formerly worked were those
of the upland regions which have kept their
forests till this day. Thus the wood and the
ores of the Harz Mountains and of the Erzgebirge,
or Iron Mountains, were of great importance
before the industrial revolution, and
up till the early part of the eighteenth century<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></a>
the German iron industry was more important
than the British.</p>

<p>The replacement of charcoal by coal led to
a great diminution of the cost of production,
and permitted the use of low-grade ores, but
it was not in itself a great improvement.
Charcoal is a singularly pure form of carbon,
and its use as the reducing agent gives a high
quality of iron. Coal, on the other hand,
often contains impurities which spoil the
iron, and have to be provided against in
various ways. Not all coal, indeed, is suitable
for iron smelting. The result is that
where charcoal can still be obtained cheaply,
as in the Scandinavian countries and in parts
of Russia, it is still used in smelting, and the
iron so produced is particularly valuable.</p>

<p>The original demand for iron, as we have
seen, was very small, and even down to the
middle of the eighteenth century remained
insignificant. But with the use of machinery,
the spread of railways, the replacement of
wood by iron in shipbuilding and for the
framework of buildings, etc., the demand in
all civilised communities has become enormous,
has become too great to permit of any
forests supplying the necessary fuel. With
the far increased demand has come an elaboration<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"><span class="pagenum">[229]</span></a>
of methods which means very costly installations
and much skill and training among
the workers.</p>

<p>From the time of the industrial revolution
till the present, then, a well-developed iron
industry has demanded the following:&mdash;fuel,
usually furnished by coal; an abundant supply
of the ore, either furnished locally or
easily obtained by water carriage, ores being
so bulky that land carriage is rarely profitable;
certain <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'accessaries'">accessories</ins>, notedly limestone
to serve as a flux, and ganister, a kind of
sandstone used to form a lining in parts of
the apparatus used; capital, necessary for the
purchase and fitting up of the costly plant;
the tradition and skill which come from the
long practice of the industry.</p>

<p>The significance of these various necessaries
may perhaps be realised by a few
examples. Let us consider first the Mediterranean
area. We have seen that it was civilised
from a very early date, that a considerable
part at least of that civilisation was
indigenous, and that its early smiths showed
no lack of skill. But with the advent of the
age of iron its natural handicap became obvious.
The forests of the region never had the
luxuriance of those further north, and must<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"><span class="pagenum">[230]</span></a>
have been early destroyed, and coal is virtually
absent. Iron ores are present and are
widely distributed; some, like those of Elba
and of northern Spain, which is outside the
area, are even rich; but the absence of fuel is
a terrible handicap, and to its absence we
must ascribe the present poverty and backwardness
of Mediterranean countries.</p>

<p>It is to be noted, however, that electricity
is coming to be used in smelting, and especially
for making particular kinds of steel,
used for special purposes. To generate this
electricity water power is being used, and the
appearance of small factories in the valleys
of the Alpine border, both in France and
Italy, perhaps marks the beginning of a
change which will restore to some of the
Mediterranean countries their ancient glory.</p>

<p>These small factories are not only employed
in manufacturing high-grade steel, but also
in making nitrogenous manure from the air,
and in other processes. In the valleys in
which they occur the inhabitants are forsaking
their phylloxera-infested vineyards for
the factories, and the association of the
neglected land with the busy factories offers
a very curious spectacle, and suggests that
the twentieth century may see great changes
in the present distribution of population.</p>

<p><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"><span class="pagenum">[231]</span></a></p>

<p>Meantime this distribution has been almost
everywhere in western Europe enormously
influenced by the distribution of coal.
Everywhere the coal has had an attractive
influence, dragging population, wealth, and
intelligence from the agricultural regions,
even the fertile regions, to the vicinity of the
coal measures, where alone great industries
can be profitably established.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, where the coal-bearing
beds are not only numerous, but in some
instances crop out at the surface, coal seems
to have been worked earlier than elsewhere
in Europe. To its earlier utilisation of coal
on a large scale Britain owes its long lead in
the struggle for industrial supremacy, and we
thus find the effect of coal upon the distribution
of the population illustrated in a more
striking way here than elsewhere. Further,
Great Britain is especially fortunate in that
iron usually occurs in close proximity to
coal, and that the other necessities for an
iron industry are easily obtainable. Its position,
sheltered by Ireland, gives it good ports,
and it is rich in other minerals as well as in
iron ores and coal.</p>

<p>The nature of the change introduced by
the great industrial revolution may be realised,<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></a>
for example, by thinking of the great
cathedrals of England, and noting how insignificant
the towns in which they are placed
are at the present day when compared with
the great centres which have sprung up near
the coalfields. Yet the very existence of
these magnificent monuments of the past
means that in the old days the towns in
which they were placed were not only centres
of population and of wealth, but had also
prestige enough to draw men’s eyes towards
them. Their very peace and cleanliness to-day
means that the life of the nation is eddying
round other centres. The emotions which
found expression in their lofty spires now seek
another outlet in the magnificent municipal
buildings, the art galleries, the hospitals, the
universities and schools of the industrial
centres.</p>

<p>The same lesson may be learnt by considering
the county towns of some of the counties
where the change wrought by the industrial
revolution has been greatest. What do the
towns of Alnwick, Durham, York, Lancaster,
Appleby, Carlisle now signify beside the great
towns in Yorkshire and Lancashire, which
depend for their existence upon the coalfields?</p>

<p>The great development of North America<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></a>
is similarly the product of the age of iron and
coal, and therefore here also population tends
to congregate round mineralised regions, and
to be sucked away from the early centres,
which were determined by other causes.</p>

<p>In brief we say that it is true generally of
the civilised world that the attraction of the
towns, of which we hear so much, is in reality
the attraction of minerals, especially of coal
and iron. This attractive power of minerals
is no new thing. When the men armed with
bronze or copper weapons and tools conquered
those with stone implements, when
iron was found to be better than all three, then
first began that long process which now acts
by sucking the countryman into the large
industrial towns.</p>

<p>When coal became supremely important
the small industries, previously scattered over
the localities where some specially favourable
conditions presented themselves, began to
concentrate near the coalfields. With the
cheap power they developed out of all proportion
to their old state, and new industries
were added to the old. Thus began that
process which made the great manufacturing
nations seek markets far beyond their own
shores, and produce far in excess of their own<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"><span class="pagenum">[234]</span></a>
needs. This, again, has led to enormous
improvements in the means of communication.
It must itself, however, be necessarily
a more or less temporary phenomenon, to be
replaced sooner or later by other conditions,
as the new nations become manufacturers in
their turn, and cease to offer unlimited markets
to the old.</p>

<p>In regard to the localisation of industries,
it is interesting to note that though the
industries are attracted towards coal, local
conditions generally determine which industry
or industries shall prosper round a particular
coalfield. The moist climate of Lancashire,
with the relative proximity of the cotton
supplies of the Southern United States, has
determined the cotton industry of Lancashire.
Once established the advantages associated
with a going concern make it very difficult
for other districts to capture trade, even when
they have greater natural advantages, <i>e. g.</i>
the Southern States themselves are now
manufacturing areas, but cannot compete on
equal terms with Lancashire.</p>

<p>It is indeed remarkable that the proximity
of raw material, except in cases when this is
very bulky, as with ores, seems often to be of
minor importance in localising industries.<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"><span class="pagenum">[235]</span></a>
Thus, though Belfast may be said to owe its
linen industry primarily to local supplies of
flax, it is noticeable that the local supply is
very limited, and several towns on the east
coast of Scotland, as Dunfermline, Montrose,
Arbroath, etc., have a flourishing linen industry
maintained entirely by imported raw
material. A whole host of facts of this kind
emphasise the importance of power in the case
of a modern industry, as contrasted with the
supreme importance of abundant raw material
in the old days when man himself chiefly
supplied the motive force.</p>

<p>In other words, modern industry has been
very closely associated with improved means
of communication, which alone make it
possible to carry cheap raw material over
great distances, without excessive expense
for freight. The study of the development
of the means of communication is therefore
a problem well worth the attention of the
geographer, and is one which has many
interesting facts to disclose.</p>

<p>Man himself is an animal relatively ill-adapted
for continuous rapid movement or
for the transport of goods. As a transport
animal he is the costliest and most inefficient
known, and were it not for the intelligence<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></a>
which enabled him first to utilise other
animals for his own purposes, and later to find
mechanical means, the progress of civilisation
would have been impossible. Progress in
Africa has been greatly checked by the fact
that over a large area man is the only transport
animal available, a fact which brings in
its train the slave trade, and many other
serious evils.</p>

<p>Except in certain special localities the
surface of the earth is so uneven that progression,
especially for a loaded man or animal,
is very difficult except on a prepared
surface. On the other hand, the diminution
of friction over a water surface makes transport
over it relatively easy. It has been
pointed out that, as a result of this fact, the
great civilisations have developed in regions
where water transport was possible, and have
involved the progressive utilisation of larger
and larger masses of water.</p>

<p>The first civilisations developed in river
valleys, where water transport in one direction
at least is very easy. The next stage was
that which saw man settled on the shores of
the great inland sea, and witnessed his gradual
acquisition of greater and greater skill in
navigation. As we have seen, he was soon<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></a>
not content with that sea alone, but launched
out into the open, and, hugging the coastline,
found his way to far Britain.</p>

<p>Only at a very much later date, however,
did he conquer the vast Atlantic outside,
which, as Prof. Myres points out, has now
become a mere inland sea in its turn, when
compared with the greater oceans beyond.
To this day, however, the part which water
transport plays in human life is reflected in
the way in which the denser masses of mankind
cluster round the shores of the seas and
oceans, as any map of the distribution of
population will show.</p>

<p>In water transport the method of propelling
the vessel employed is of great importance.
In river navigation it is natural to allow the
boat to drift with the current, and the use of
a pole to steer with would naturally suggest
its use as a paddle or oar in order to move
against the current. In North America up
till the appearance of the white man, the
aborigines had not got past the paddle stage,
in spite of the fact that they were very skilful
navigators, and had a considerable variety of
vessels.</p>

<p>The next stage is of course the sail, used by
most races who venture on open water, as<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></a>
contrasted with flowing streams and rivers.
Although before its virtual replacement by
steam, the civilised races had carried the
development of the sail to a very high pitch,
yet the difficulties associated with it militated
against bold navigation, more especially in
the early days when there was no science of
meteorology. Thus it has been pointed out
that the reason why the effective discovery of
America was delayed so long was largely
due to two meteorological facts. The first
of these is that to the north, the place where
the crossing is narrowest, the ice which
streams down the west coast of Greenland,
and even to this day presents difficulties to
navigation off the coasts of Newfoundland,
formed an effective barrier to early navigators.
To the south the great difficulty was the constant
north-east trade wind. What ship dare
set out towards the unknown blown by a
constant wind against which she could not
return home again? To Columbus first, says
Mr. Mackinder, came the brilliant inspiration
that, while travelling outwards with the trade,
it would be possible to return with the westerly
breezes of more northern latitudes.</p>

<p>When, later, the sail was functionally
replaced by steam, man became virtually<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"><span class="pagenum">[239]</span></a>
independent of the wind, and only the name
of trade wind remains to carry us back to the
period when the ocean breezes determined his
movements and his commerce.</p>

<p>Turning now to the surface of the land, we
may note that regions which are snow-covered
in winter offer special facilities for rapid
locomotion. In the northern part of North
America, both in the tundra and the forest
region, the aborigines used both snow-shoes
and sledges. The Eskimos to the north use
dogs to draw their heavy sledges, but to the
south the Indians used a lighter form of
sledge, which was dragged by women, and
therefore represents a much more primitive
form of transport. Even down to the present
time the conditions in Arctic America are
such that transport facilities are very much
greater in winter than in summer, except in
regions close to navigable rivers.</p>

<p>Snow-sledges and snow-shoes of course
occur also on the European side of the Atlantic
to the north, but the domesticated reindeer
replaces the dog in Lapland as the means of
traction, though dogs are used in other parts
of the tundra region of the old world.</p>

<p>Apart from snow-covered regions deserts
afford another example of areas in which the<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"><span class="pagenum">[240]</span></a>
surface is frequently so uniform that friction
is greatly reduced, and rapid movement is
possible without specially prepared tracks.
In the Sahara, for example, which is far from
being the waste of sand which is popularly
imagined, there are great areas of almost level
surface, where “the soil is firm and elastic,
strewn with gravel, and like a garden walk.”
In Algiers it is possible to drive in high dog-carts
over the plateau region in any direction,
regardless of roads, and in parts of the North
American desert the same thing is true. It
has been suggested, indeed, that wheeled
vehicles were invented by races living near
desert regions, and that the invention thus
preceded the making of roads.</p>

<p>In the general case, however, rapid movement
is bound up with the existence of roads
or tracks. In parts of North America,
notably in the region south and east of the
Great Lakes, where the rivers are generally
unsuitable for navigation by very primitive
forms of boats, the original Indian inhabitants
mostly moved by means of “trails” through
the woods. These trails were the lines of
migration of the larger mammals, especially
of the bison, and it is a remarkable fact that
the roads made later by the white immigrants<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"><span class="pagenum">[241]</span></a>
sometimes followed these old trails, which
proved to be the most convenient routes.
This suggests one method in which roads and
paths might originate, but the Indian trails,
like the African negroes’ paths through the
forest, were excessively narrow and inconvenient.</p>

<p>Another stage in road evolution is well
illustrated in many mountain regions, <i>i. e.</i> in
the less-frequented parts of the Alps. Here
the mountains are crossed by narrow tracks,
which die away at intervals and then reappear.
They are chiefly used by the herdsmen
and cattle, during the periodical migrations
to the higher pastures, and this fact
gives rise to certain peculiarities. Where the
region traversed is very steep the path is
usually well marked, and there may be even
attempts to improve difficult parts so as to
render it more practicable. When the ground
becomes more level the path dies away, or
divides up into a multitude of minor tracks.
The reason is obvious. In the steep regions
the cows must keep together, and their constant
journeyings render the road well marked.
It must also be easy enough to permit of the
passage of the animals, whose agility has its
limits. Where the ground is level grass usually<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></a>
grows, and here the cattle spread out in
all directions to feed, and the path naturally
dies away. It may be marked on the map as
going on to cross a col and so reach another
valley, but as the number of persons making
the traverse is likely to be small, the track is
badly marked, as many a tourist has found
to his cost.</p>

<p>From such tracks, which are little more
than aids in crossing specially difficult areas,
to the well-made roads which traverse the
civilised countries of the world the gap is
great, for, though the Romans made magnificent
roads, after their time there was a rapid
decay in the art, and the well-kept roads of the
western countries of Europe are things but of
yesterday.</p>

<p>With the development of tracks and roads,
as distinct from a mere animal trail through
the bush, there comes the possibility of using
pack-animals and wheeled vehicles for transport.
The two do not necessarily occur
together. Thus in China and Japan wheeled
vehicles are drawn by human beings, though
in China the wheelbarrows drawn by human
porters have also sails to aid their propulsion.</p>

<p>The use of animals, whether as pack-animals<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></a>
or for traction, means a relatively
high degree of civilisation, and means also a
food supply normally more than enough for
the human members of the community. In
many parts of tropical Africa, despite the
tropical luxuriance of many of the food plants,
and the absence of winter, there is practically
no food reserve, and the normal condition is
that the whole group is within measurable
reach of starvation, should any one of a whole
series of probable or possible accidents happen
to the plantations. Under such conditions
large domestic animals, requiring great quantities
of food, cannot be kept.</p>

<p>Again, where the population is dense, and
all the land is required to grow food for man,
it is not possible to set aside regions for the
pasturage of domestic animals, whose numbers
must necessarily then be small. This is
true of China and Japan, where domestic
hoofed animals are few in number. The contrary
condition is of course seen in new countries,
like Australia and the Argentine, where
there are far fewer men than sheep and cattle.
The United States is beginning to pass from
this condition, and there have been published
already warnings to the community
that it cannot go on giving up much of its<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"><span class="pagenum">[244]</span></a>
fertile land to the growth of crops for its
domestic animals, instead of for its citizens
directly.</p>

<p>Of the domestic animals which have assisted
man in the work of transport there can be
no doubt that the horse is by far the most
valuable. It is the strongest, the swiftest,
and the best <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fisted'">fitted</ins> for man’s purposes. The
camel, of which so much has been written, is
in point of fact a poor substitute for the more
valuable animal, rendered necessary by desert
conditions. Among the other animals which
have played their part as beasts of burden or
of traction are many kinds of ox, including
the yak of Tibet; the llama of South America;
the elephant; the reindeer; the dog; and
the animals which rank as horses to the zoologist
though not to the owner&mdash;that is the ass
and the mule.</p>

<p>Just as the use of beasts of burden is an
enormous improvement upon human porters,
and that of wheeled vehicles upon beasts of
burden, so is the use of steam an enormous
improvement upon wheeled vehicles drawn
by animals. Railways have practically revolutionised
the problem of land transport,
though their cost, especially in countries of
marked relief, is a great drawback to their<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></a>
universal use. The last few years have seen
in the development of motor-driven vehicles a
new change, which has given back to the roads
their old importance, and which will probably
in the future greatly aid the development of
new countries, and take from the railways
some of their importance. It is too soon yet
to say whether the last development of means
of transport, the aeroplane, is destined to
affect greatly man’s movements and methods
of exchanging commodities.</p>

<p>In connection with means of communication
a few words must be said about towns and
their position, a subject in which the “new
geography” has been greatly interested.
In this chapter we have assumed that the
progress of civilisation means, and has always
meant, an increasing desire on the part of
man for freedom of movement, and an
increasing number of wants, which have led in
their turn to an increasing desire for the exchange
of commodities. The desire to possess
efficient tools and weapons first attracted
him, as we have seen, to the localities where
useful minerals occurred. The new powers
so obtained increased his desires, and also his
mobility, and tended to make him cluster
round the spots where his new desires could<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"><span class="pagenum">[246]</span></a>
best be gratified. At a very early stage the
desire to exchange commodities must have
led to the founding of towns, whose number
and size have increased with the passage of
time.</p>

<p>Of the various causes which have led to the
founding of towns at certain spots, some are
obvious. That which has always attracted
most attention perhaps is the fortress town,
placed on some rocky peak, and commanding
a well-marked route. But though such towns
are imposing, and seem easily explained, it is
obvious that at no stage of his history has
warfare been man’s chronic state. Even at
the worst period, if there had been no busy
group of traders at the foot of the fortress-crowned
rock, its significance could only have
been trifling, and almost all fortress towns
show, in the proximity of another agglomeration
more suited to normal human activities,
that the fortress itself was always rather
spectacular than significant. Edinburgh, with
the old city sloping down to the plain from
the great rock, Carcassonne with the real city
some distance from the theatrical erection on
the hill, are two examples which illustrate this
fact.</p>

<p>One or two of the chief economic causes of<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"><span class="pagenum">[247]</span></a>
towns may be noted. They tend to occur
where there is a “break of bulk” in goods
being carried from one region to another.
Such break of bulk now takes place at the
great ports where the liners unload, but in the
old days the small ships came up the rivers
with the tide, and towns tended to occur at
the tidal limit, as, <i>e. g.</i> at Newcastle-on-Tyne.
Towns tend also to occur near natural obstacles
to easy transport. Thus we have in
England a great number of “bridge towns,”
placed at the point where an important river
was easily bridged or forded, and thus where
co-operative effort was necessary to smooth
over an obstacle. Towns tend to occur also
where two regions of different natural products
meet, for here the inhabitants of the two
regions meet for the purpose of exchange of
goods. Milan, at the foot of the Alps and yet
in the plain, is a good example, for the
products of the plains are not those of the
mountains.</p>

<p>Many cities owe their origin and their fame
to some event, often some religious association
which draws great numbers of pilgrims
and others. It is often doubtful, however, to
what extent the supposed cause is the real
cause of the city’s importance. Not every<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></a>
saint founds a city, not every holy city keeps
its fame, and in the struggle for existence
those cities will persist whose natural advantages
are greatest.</p>

<p>Another very important cause of cities is a
junction of routes, for this means that many
different types of merchandise will pass this
way, and will give abundant raw material for
many minor industries. London is a good
example of a town upon which many routes
converge, these being both land routes and
water routes.</p>

<p>Even these few examples may serve to
suggest the point of view from which the
modern geographer regards towns, and to
illustrate the fact that in this as in other
branches of his subject his interest is in the
study of causes and of interrelations.</p>

<h2>NOTES ON BOOKS</h2>


<p>Most of the subjects which have been treated in this
book fall under the heading of physical geography, and
therefore we may begin these notes by recommending two
large works of reference on this subject. Salisbury’s
<i>Physiography</i> (New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1907, $3.50
net) is the most comprehensive work on the subject in
English. In French there is an admirable book by E. de
Martonne, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Géographie Physique</i> (Paris: Armand
Colin, 1909, price 22 fr.), to be especially recommended
for its beautiful plates and diagrams, and for its copious
references.</p>

<p>For the subjects treated in the individual chapters the
following, among others, may be consulted. Suess’s book
translated as <i>The Face of the Earth</i> (Oxford: Clarendon
Press, still in course of publication, price £4 net) is the
classical book on earth structure and relief, and has stimulated
research enormously, but it is not easy to read. For
climatology the classical book is Hann’s <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Handbuch</i>, of
which the general part has been translated by Ward as
<i>Handbook of Climatology</i> (New York: The Macmillan Co.,
1903, price 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>). For plant geography reference
should be made to Schimper’s <i>Plant Geography</i>, translated
by Fisher (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1903, price 42<i>s.</i>
net), which is again the classical treatise, and the basis of
most of the later work. For the races of Europe we have
in W. Z. Ripley’s <i>Races of Europe</i> (London: Kegan Paul,
Trench, Trübner &amp; Co., 1900, price 18<i>s.</i> net) a most
interesting book, not difficult and full of most instructive
diagrams. Another aspect of the same subject is treated
in Sergi’s <i>The Mediterranean Race</i> (Contemporary Science
Series, London: Walter Scott, 1901, price 6<i>s.</i>), but this is
very controversial in tone. For the work of ice, the most
important book is <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Alpen im Eiszeitalter</i> by A. Penck
and G. Brückner (Leipzig: Tauchnitz, 1909, price 55
marks), but the line of reasoning followed in it does not
convince all geographers, and the subject is still fiercely
debated.</p>

<p>Turning now to more general aspects of the subject we
have in <i>The International Geography</i>, edited by H. R. Mill,
and written by many authors (now published by Macmillan,
London&mdash;new edition 1907, price 12<i>s.</i> net; also
published in parts for school use), a most comprehensive
and authoritative work, which includes the whole globe
in its survey, and has also general chapters on various
aspects of geography. It is, however, a difficult book,<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"><span class="pagenum">[250]</span></a>
intended for study rather than for general reading, and
is very much condensed. A book which, though dealing
only with a very limited region, yet contrives in discussing
that area to give the essentials of modern geographical
science, is Mackinder’s <i>Britain and the British Seas</i> (second
edition. 1907. Oxford: Clarendon Press, price 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>).</p>

<p>It should be in all geographical libraries.</p>

<p>As commercial geography is one of the sides from which
geography appeals most strongly to the general reader,
we may note that the classic is G. G. Chisholm’s <i>Handbook
of Commercial Geography</i> (New York: Longmans, Green
&amp; Co., price $4.80 net). First published in 1889 it is
brought up to date in successive editions, and is full of
interest for the general public as well as for the geographer.
In the same connection we may note J. G. Bartholomew’s
admirable <i>Atlas of the World’s Commerce</i> (London: George
Newnes, 1907, price 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>), which is of great assistance
in studying the subject owing to its very clear maps and
diagrams. A smaller and cheaper work by the same
author is <i>A School Economic Atlas</i> (Oxford: University
Press, 1910, price 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net).</p>

<p>There are an enormous number of small books on
geographical subjects, for these as well as for others
reference may be made to a useful little volume called
<i>Guide to Geographical Books and Appliances</i>, which is
compiled by members of the Geographical Association
(London: Geo. Philip, 1910, price 5<i>s.</i>). This is especially
intended for teachers, but gives full descriptions, with
critical notes, of a great number of books. To the list
given there we may add one book which, though intended
for school use, may be noted as containing a great deal
of information of the kind which is just beginning to find
its way into the smaller text-books. This is Unstead and
Taylor’s <i>General and Regional Geography for Students</i>
(London: Geo. Philip, 1910, price 6<i>s.</i>). An excellent
practical book is Simmons and Richardson’s <i>Introduction
to Practical Geography</i> (New York: The Macmillan Co.,
1907, price 90 cts.).</p>

<p>Finally, we may note that the <i>Geographical Journal</i>,
published monthly by the Royal Geographical Society in
London, and the <i>Scottish Geographical Magazine</i>, published
monthly by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society
in Edinburgh, both give reviews and accounts of all important
geographical books, as they appear, with abstracts
of important articles and papers, as well as publishing
original papers. Both are obtainable at most libraries.</p>
